- #lunabrain/work
	- Need to get the tiltfile in order so that deployment/local dev makes sense
		- This needs to be bulletproof so people can play with it
	- Human assisted docbot
		- Based on terms/questions that are commonly asked, results of what are sent back are reviewed and custom context can be loaded to provide higher quality results.
		- You can configure the behavior of questions being answered by guiding the question asking process
- #protoflow/work
	- the bulider/parser for the protobuf schema is a layer that gets compiled into the existing protobuf schema used to represent a workflow https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/builder#section-documentation
		- Tried getting this to work, was able to parse options, but got stuck when trying to read the options. The options are showing up as "unknown". We are pushing the limits of what protobuf was designed for, so while there might be an easy solution for this problem, there may be others to follow. The more conservative approach to developing here is to keep building on the system that was designed and work with it. This seems somewhat promising for future exploration. Work that was done is captured in `parse.go` and `parse_test.go`
	- Code needs to end up in a configured folder, not the cache directory
		- What do you call a folder that contains the code?
			- Code bucket
	- add resource needs create resource. how the fuck does the grpc code for adding resources work?

	- AI is the big one. We need to be ready by diversifying how AI sees the world. It starts with diversity of thought.
- #golang/libraries/ideas CLI and config integration
	- it feels awkward to access CLI args inside of a some provided dependency. this doesn't feel like a solved problem, I would expect to be able to access CLI args inside of a dependency through the config options. What does that look like?
