- #lunabrain/work
	- need to let a user control oauth login and password
	- how should built websites be stored and retrieved?
		- github pages, current
		- bucket, route domain to bucket
			- cheap
			- some infra to manage
		- an option is to run service, host assets, cache them with headers
			- how can you invalidate them?
			- probably want to put assets in bucket anyways?
			- probably easier to manage in short term
			- paywall assets?
	- need some type of definition for assets and where they go
	- images need durable links
	- need markdown to render properly
	- need to backup db
	- as I am typing, I want search to be automatically pulling up relevant resources from what I have written about previously, websites I have visited
		- composing more robust content
	- need to setup CI/CD for justshare
	- need to move lunabrain -> justshare
