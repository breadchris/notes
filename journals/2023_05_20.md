	- When should types be considered?
	- To turn protoflow into a grpc server where you can kick off workflows, you can use "connect_go.NewUnaryHandler" (and others for streaming) and then route based on the path. This GRPC server will be dynamically generated.
	- Blocks that belong to a resource can be "short circuited" where they run from inside of the context of the resource, when possible, this will reduce cost of round trip. You lose the "durable" guarantee if you go this route
	- The data layer for protoflow needs to be its own thing. I want to be able to look back on what data I generated and I want to hook that data into blocks. Keeping this on it's own layer will declutter the interface. The data is one level higher than the code.

	- AI models act as the "last mile" of information display. Underlying data aggregation and reasoning are protoflow workflows. LunaBrain provides easy to use primitives which supercharge. You can build bespoke Protoflows to scale contracted efforts with few people. Code reusability becomes very efficient, and only gets faster the more blocks which are available.

		- **Reducing the delay between the thought and the ability to execute the action (i.e. latency) is crucial for unlocking digital joy.** The organisation process is usually the major stumbling block. The question of "where do I put this?" when inputting information and "where do I find that again?" when retrieving information, take us out of the flow of our work. We need to constantly switch modes to thinking about the location of a file, rather than the topic we were previously engaged with.
