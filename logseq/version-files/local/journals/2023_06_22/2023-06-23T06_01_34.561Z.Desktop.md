	- updating a protobuf file in place is working better now that I figured out how to unlink messages and stuff
	- figuring out why there is an infinite loop for map<string, string> metadata
	- later on, I will need to launch an attack on the codebase to make sure that fully qualified names are being used everywhere
		- this will probably come at the same time that the idea of a registry is more built out
	- just did a refactor of node information. node information now comes from a resource which will make things like integration with tilt, where we are watching for file changes, trigger a repopulation of node type information.
