      <description>I run a cyber security competition for high schoolers every year. Yesterday was the 7th iteration. Months of planning go into designing the story and putting together digital evidence for the competitors to try to solve a murder mystery. It was a special event because the organizers who built it for my high school self stoked my passion for security. Unfortunately, it did not go as planned this year. After giving the introduction talk to 350 students, the site got DOSed from the concurrent load of everyone accessing it.</description>

      <description>Hey y&amp;rsquo;all,
Maybe it is the poor Internet connection in Ireland, but I feel disconnected. Watching a site load brings me back to when you had to find offline tasks while waiting. Breaking up a hyperconnected workflow has helped immensely with building focus.
I am finishing up an annual cyber security competition I will run in Maryland soon. I&amp;rsquo;ll share when I am done; it is enjoyable to play 😊 After I clear that off my plate, my focus will fall on building a course on service design patterns.</description>

      <description>I have so much goddamn respect for web developers. A long list of side projects has consumed a significant amount of my time and have been riddled with frustration. What is most frustrating when writing a web app is understanding what tools to use. React, Vue, Svelte? Tailwind, the component library of the week, SASS, CSS? Everyone has opinions, and the &amp;ldquo;principled&amp;rdquo; stances are mostly comparisons against other technologies. Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time considering how to build web apps with a &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; approach.</description>

      <description>Someone probably looked up one day and said, &amp;ldquo;That is the &amp;lsquo;sky&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; They told their friends, and then they told their friends. At some point, when anyone looked up at the vast expanse above them and needed a way to describe it, the word that came to mind was &amp;ldquo;sky.&amp;rdquo;
Maybe there is something that you are looking at in your life that will have a similar story one day. It might not be as profound as naming &amp;ldquo;sky,&amp;rdquo; but it describes a service we use like &amp;ldquo;Google&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Uber.</description>

      <description>It may seem silly, but go run is my favorite part about go. Want to run your code? go run main.go. It is so stupidly simple that I could tell my mom about this command, and she would immediately understand. Like with most things in go, the real power in this command is in the effortless understanding of how to build and run everyone&amp;rsquo;s code.
But I can run node main.</description>

      <description>Joining and participating in one group cuts in half your odds of dying next year.
Every ten minutes of commuting reduces all forms of social capital by 10%
Watching commercial entertainment TV is the only leisure activity where doing more of it is associated with lower social capital.
Trends over the last 25 years Attending Club Meetings 58% drop
Family dinners 43% drop
Having friends over 35% drop

      <title>you should try a partner dance</title>

      <description>I have been going swing dancing at Century Ballroom every week since the start of the year. Swing is a partner dance that has leaders and followers. Before every song, it is customary for the leader, typically a guy, to ask a follower, usually a girl, to dance, and when the song ends, the leader finds another follower to dance with for the next song. For someone with social anxiety, this can be pretty intimidating.</description>

      <title>Naming is Important</title>

      <description>Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing.</description>

      <description>Every morning, as the first light bled into the room, the software engineer&amp;rsquo;s alarm would chirp, marking another day&amp;rsquo;s beginning. The routine was as predictable as the sunrise. Wake, stretch, sip a coffee, and sit before the computer.
The screen springs to life, revealing a grid of familiar faces. Standup meeting — the daily ritual. Each square held an expression; some were tired, some eager, but all were familiar. Pixels and bandwidth conveying nuances, the raise of an eyebrow, the half-hidden yawn.</description>

When you look at the camera, you will see stacks of uniquely generated cards. Each card is created by an AI based on a short prompt. We have various themes for these cards, and each theme has a corresponding image and a Chat GPT Element name.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like how long it takes for me to figure out ideas. Too much code is written before I figure out what I wanted is not what I made. There is a bookstore near me that I frequent and on the shelf was the book Drawing Ideas. Through this book, I have come to appreciate the importance of sketching in unlocking creativity and exploring new avenues of value. Through observation and simplification, sketching allows us to see our ideas projected onto a medium, much like using our voice to sketch out thoughts verbally.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool idea! It&amp;rsquo;s like having a conversation that gets transcribed into a blog post in real-time. So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about hopes and dreams.</description>

      <description>I had a Substack where I would occasionally post some things on AI. The vision was to build a following, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t execute it. There may be some &amp;ldquo;blaming the equipment, not the player&amp;rdquo; here, but from what I have learned, my writing flow feels so much better now:
First of all, I think Substack is great. Its mission is clear, and overall, they do a great job executing it (much better than Medium, imo).</description>

      <description>You can think about a lot of different things all the time. Think about too many things and this becomes a serious problem, especially for those who have ADD. If you have a problem focusing on which idea to pursue, it is easy to experience the feeling of being lost. Life is happening, ideas come and go, but there is nothing for you to bring to show and tell.
I am not an expert in this field of study, but I do pay attention to what constitutes a “great thinker”.</description>

      <title>AI Can&#39;t Fold 1000 Cranes</title>

Folding 1000 origami cranes sounds at lot easier than it is. When my engineer mind latched onto the idea of completing this task, I was intrigued by the foretold wish one would get in exchange for folding a bunch of the easiest origami models. Kids do this every year in Japan, how hard could it be? - On average, it would take me 5 minutes to fold a crane from start to finish.</description>

      <description>So i was in a really good high school https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolesville_High_School and so there would be some ridiculously smart people who would work on things and because the program was so close knit, information would disseminate between the grades and so the younger group of kids would only get that much better. I got involved in cyber security because the older kids competed in a competition that was for hacking and they did very well.</description>

      <description>- I have worked for Northrup Grumman and Uber as a security engineer and I built security tools that have been used around the world. The coolest thing that I have done in my life is that I got to help develop code that ran on every device that had Uber installed on it. The purpose of this code was to help the 20% Uber was losing to fraudulent trips. The talent needed to work on a project like this was so rare that I was hired on as the first team member, as an intern and later hired on as a college dropout.</description>

Either I or someone else who vaguely understands how to code was going to hack you like this. Business requirements for shipping that feature out at lighting speed for your largest customer last quarter made this all too easy.

      <description>## How it went wrong
I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time. The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU.</description>

      <description>Ok, there is just simply way too much shit that you have to learn to host a freaking website . Let’s make that easier.
Start with Markdown and hugo. Markdown is trivial to learn and making a website is instant. Hugo is a single binary you download, run and boom there is your website. A number of themes are available for you to check out and play with, but they aren’t necessary to start out.</description>

      <description>## SOLID principles
The set of five design principles for object-oriented programming that were first introduced by Robert C. Martin. These principles are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
In Go, the SOLID principles can be applied as follows:
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Example:
```go
type UserService struct {
userRepository UserRepository
}
func (us *UserService) CreateUser(user *User) error {
return us.userRepository.Create(user)
}
func (us *UserService) GetUserByID(id int) (*User, error) {</description>

      <description>## Playing with Legos
Legos are fun, they are composable. Code is not composable, not at least in the way we learn to code.
Different environments come with different constraints which end up with different code. Different ecosystems have different standards and ways to solve a problem.
Legos have been designed to have an incredibly rigid specification that has been upheld for many years. It is trivial to determine impostor bricks (I am looking at you Mega Blocks) from an actual Lego.</description>

Whether it is a math problem with seemingly random symbols or trying to comprehend why my parents won’t get along with each other.</description>
