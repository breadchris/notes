- #lunabrain/work
	- fixing spacing between bar and content
		- too much space
	- Content wants to exist within a domain, and referenced by a path
		- multiple paths can reference the same content
		- a path is a "tag"
		- a domain is a "group"
		- in this system

	- The Living Room Cafe
		- https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ijizM2oegzT2Szs5
		- Connected to a typical seattle copy and paste apartment complex
		- While the reviews are high, I would not rate this place high
		- Nice cafe aesthetic, but in a manufactured kind of way vs an organic cafe vibe. You should check it out if you are in the area.
