- #go/book Finding other people's code
	- If you want to write code that other people can use, they need to be able to find it. Go stream lines this process in two ways. The code itself comes from a git repository. There are no registries that contain bundled assets, just the code as it is being developed by the maintainers. There is however a proxy that will be used by default to resolve packages. This only exists to speed up how people access the code, you can always run your proxy to manage how source code is saved. The other way that people can find Go code is through the package documentation site https://pkg.go.dev/.

	- Lifecycle of code
		- Code starts small and gets bigger. You develop a language within the language to express the problem you are trying to solve. Start loose, tighten up core components as you go.
	- Developing interfaces
	- Dependency injection
	- Code without side effects
	- Running other people's code
