0	10640	I guess we're gonna try to record this thought with a regular mic so I guess you
10640	20840	could listen to this as kind of like a podcast all right I guess I guess this is
20840	30720	the official high-pinkies podcast because effectively what I can do if this
30720	38840	audio is embedded in my site is I can link this to hashtag high-pinkies and I could
38840	46240	put that out there so isn't hasn't logsec effectively made the perfect
46240	58120	podcasting platform because I could just record my thoughts and I could listen to
58120	68760	them back someone else could listen to them back maybe I have the the GitHub
68760	76960	like the script thing where I can turn speech into text but if I have that set
76960	88400	up then I can I can go back and turn turn my the audio that I'm saying until
88400	97080	like the perfect yeah the perfect podcasting platform I don't see why this
97080	109640	wouldn't work and actually you know what I can do is I could just record a
109640	117840	video so if I I wonder how well this would work if I just wanted to if I could
117840	123160	sync my phone with my remarkable then I could just take out a sheet of
123160	130440	paper right effectively that's what I'd be doing and writing down my notes and
130440	136500	that could effectively screencast right because you can set up a VNC
136500	142740	server on a remarkable you could screencast to your phone like I need to
142740	150040	figure out if you can do video or if it's feasible to do video recording over
150040	158880	VNC I guess you have to be connected the same local network which is fine I
158880	167120	mean you're probably on your home Wi-Fi network or if you're walking around I
167120	172600	think maybe you could do like a mobile hotspot
172600	181920	to connect to and then maybe you're remarkable I guess I need to figure out if you
181920	195960	have your iPhone connected or set up as a hotspot can your phone talk to can it
195960	213000	talk to I'm trying a blank yeah right okay right if you have a mobile hotspot
213000	219440	can your phone connect to another device that is shared on the mobile hotspot I
219440	227000	guess is what I'm saying so like as I'm talking right I can talk I can have my
227000	232680	words roughly translated into text right at least like the the words that are
232680	239240	if they're nonsense you can click on that word and it will take you to that point
239240	248440	in time in the audio and then I could also write if I wanted to just stream my
248440	253680	notes taking right because I have the remarkable I can take out my remarkable I
253680	260520	can have it be running a VNC server for that my phone connects to right because
260520	263640	they're on the same local network and they should be able to find each other and
263640	269480	then I just record that as a video and then I also insert that into lock set
269480	277120	because it can just reference notes so in the repo there would like for this
277120	286480	entry there would be the audio there would be the playback text which in lock
286480	292000	set mobile you wouldn't be able to see but you could write a plug-in right on the
292000	294000	desktop that
311000	320560	damn why am I doing a blank plug-in on the desktop that would
322560	327240	run as
330840	345280	JS that would hopefully this doesn't sound completely okay here and because this is
345280	350720	for sure this is like I guess that's the whole point of the high think he's
350720	358720	broadcast is that it's literally going to sound ridiculous and that's what
358720	368360	makes I think he's special you just record yourself thinking
368360	382000	yeah anyway I hope I'm able to listen to this back and I guess no I don't need
382000	385240	to listen to this back because I wanted to try to develop this because
385240	391040	theoretically I think he's with even with massive gaps the text that you read
391040	398480	would be different like you could just zoom around to the parts that interest you
398480	403120	so if I start talking about cooking right I could rattle off like an
403120	409640	ingredient recipe for example like like if I could speak naturally and I could
409640	417200	say to make a pie crust right and so or I just like say the words like new
417200	434840	recipe pie crust one part flour one part butter then a little bit of salt and if
434840	446680	I'm still here still just thinking so I would say change and
447200	470560	I would say change and then I would change the recipe step so for example I would
470560	489280	change the recipe step two what you would call it oh I would change the first
489280	506280	recipe step of pie crust to be combined flour salt sugar in bowl which would
506280	512080	then like mark that as the step and then for the second one right I would say on
512080	521840	this like podcast thing you like you tag it right so it's like I said the word I'm
521840	524840	just going to say we're in a word right Harvard I don't know why I'm taking
524840	532320	hard but I say Harvard and I pronounced it clearly enough that it added the tag
532320	546000	Harvard you could then create a whole page that is like the Grap Results of a whole
546000	555240	page in Logsack that is like the Grap Results of me saying Harvard right I search
555240	563160	through all these like text documents right because that's what this audio would turn
563160	569560	into right it would turn into a text document and it wouldn't be perfect but it's like good
569560	575800	enough right the conversion be good enough that I could go back through everything that
575800	587120	I've said right all my notes on something and recall them so for example let's just like
587120	596880	what's the stupid example of this like I say the word balloon right I say the word right
596880	604480	now and then maybe tomorrow right maybe tomorrow I go to a circus for whatever reason and
604480	611600	at the circus they have balloons right so this would be the second entry into my note
611600	622280	taking journal is balloons so now like through analysis of the text you can identify words
622280	630040	or you put that into essentially your personal search engine which I'm going to see right
630040	636260	so I have my notes up right now and I'm going to try to see if I can find this search engine
636260	653560	that I saved because I saw it before but I don't quite know so basically if this thing I can
653560	673080	definitely had it like somewhere search it was like index damn like so for example if so
673080	688120	there's this tool that I have in mind if it was like really fast it was like really fast
688120	695000	right so if I said like I'm reading hacker news right so I start my day and I just hit
695000	711480	record right and I start talking and it's like talking about hacker news then then I would have
711480	718560	this thought right of searching like I could then search for the tags like and maybe it works
718560	738800	maybe maybe I can do that so search for say hacker news and it was thinking about search now see if
738800	743760	when I saved that article as browsing the internet and I saved that article if it did text extraction
743760	753360	because right this is what I want to do this is the whole point of 50 is I can make it trivial like in
753360	773360	like a an API call a single API call I could turn a holy shit this could be huge like I could just
773360	786080	fork log sec right could I just fork log sec
786080	806240	I don't know is it like a hacker news and then search now index goddamn what was it maybe I can go
806240	815120	online it's very usually so I can leave my note now oh my god this is so funny my face didn't
815600	821840	cool type sensor that's a note now if I wanted to right I could tag it because it right it took
821840	830480	me so long to put this in right because that way I can search things from oh it's not called
830560	836960	hacker news it's called white combinator but I remember it in my head is hacker news right so and I'm
836960	849200	going to take this note right now and I'm going to say hashtag we'll say hashtag what's what I want to
849200	864560	say oh no I guess this is like I think he's going to link it to the page I think he is
864560	885600	whoops I come on I think he's that page cool
885600	898160	right so this thing and this is the right and if I had this this fucking the title of the page and I
898160	909360	wouldn't have to copy it all this shit down so annoying oh my goodness
909360	928080	it's not quite organized the way that I wanted to oh well be like close enough maybe
939680	945920	I think it's working hopefully
945920	962160	so I'm going on this train of thought I guess maybe I'll stop here see what happens
