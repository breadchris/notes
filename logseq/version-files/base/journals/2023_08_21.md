		- generator
		- solver
- #protoflow/work
	- learn react https://epicreact.dev/ #programming/react
	- when returning back data from a node's execution, the node should be able to enumerate how the value can be viewed in the UI
		- need a metadata field on node execution
	- refactor code generator code, make it easier to add a new function
	- http router
		- send incoming requests to channel
		- observe responses
	- removed temporal and memory manager https://github.com/protoflow-labs/protoflow/commit/65880dbf27ad3010bef3b50e82b5e811226a9c94 #protoflow/scale
	- programmable document store
		- collect documents
	- #protoflow/product you can register domain names for people
		- give them blocks to buy their own domain names
		- https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.registrations/register
		- or cloudflare https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/
		- https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/register-domain
		- it would be nice to give people the github codespaces experience
			- you should be able to drop a codespaces file in there so that people can hack on the go
			- they should be able to take ideas they have for code (by highlighting, etc) and have it be able to be committed and dropped into a block

	- it seems that the go bindings for streaming is just too slow https://github.com/djthorpe/go-whisper
	- using the dedicated streaming example from whisper is much more real time
	- web clipper https://clipper.website/ #chrome/extension
		- a good starter chrome extension to add sharing capabilities to https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/tree/master
- #life/observations/programming
	- the zen of go is giving up a lot of things in the name of simplicty
	- local dev is 10x easier than dev on a team, dev on a team is 10x easier than CI, CI is 10x easier than production, etc.
	- so if something isnt simple on local dev, that annoyance scales a lot
	- the whole principle of protoflow is if it can't fit into a single executable, it isn't something that is going to be easy to build a business around, you can make it work, but it is going to cause you a lot of frustration which is distracting you from the real question of: What is the actual value of your company?
	- our security products go way too caught in the technical weeds of things, when we should have focused on a much simpler prototype that people wished they had yesterday
