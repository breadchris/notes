- #life/observations Learning about shit
	- I think there is a point with learning where you find yourself at a point where there are a lot of resources pointing you towards some concept, but you can’t find any content on that concept that you really enjoy reading. For example, maybe there is no book on the topic, so you have to read many different white papers to learn about it, which is not ideal. If everything you have read has convinced you that this concept is the thing that has been missing from your understanding of your “mission”, then you should probably suck it up and just learn it.
