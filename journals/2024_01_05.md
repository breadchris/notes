- #[[cookwherever/gluten free]]
	- I have gone through a number of gluten-free resources at this point ranging from random online blogs to Modernist Bread's 5 volume set on everything bread. There are a lot of patterns in these books and I hope to distill the information that I have found useful in my gluten free journey.
	- ATK How could it be gluten free
	- Modernist bread
	- Gluten free bread in 5
	- Promises kept or whatever it is called
	- Modernist pantry
	- That research book by the food coalition
	- It was pretty mind blowing when I realized that all gluten-free recipes are just trying to replicate the unique properties of wheat flour and the gluten that is formed when water is added. In this post I want to outline what wheat flour brings to the table, and then what elements go into a state of the art gluten-free bread recipe to replicate this behavior.
	- Gluten-Full Bread Properties
	- Gluten-Free Elements
	- Flours
	- Starches
	- Binders
	- Gums
	- Enzymes
	- While my body requires me to be as gluten-free as possible, I find gluten-free baking as an exciting challenge to push the limits of what we can do as bakers to make something that you can slather jam on or use to complete your favorite sandwich. I personally eat a number of things that I prefer to their gluten-full counterparts, but unfortunately there is a pretty big stigma around gluten-free products just "not being good". I task all the bakers reading this to break down this precognition by baking for your friends and surprise them when they are five cookies deep by telling them what they ate was gluten-free.

	- Collection of substitions - http://www.foodsubs.com/
	  Ingredients can be substitued, but their functional purpose, as they relate to the recipe are very important. Using milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk is generally ok, however if a lot of buttermilk is required, then the resulting flavor might be off.

	- no checkout was set to `false`, and that was causing some weird issue where files would not be staged. setting it to `true` fixed this problem

	  // If a branch is specified but no specific commit for checkout is specified, we can go ahead and checkout that branch and only the latest commit
	  // if a commit is specified, we are going to go into a detached HEAD on some unknown branch in a later step, so clone everything for now
	  if snapshotOptions.GitBranch != "" && snapshotOptions.GitCommit == "" {
