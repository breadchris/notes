- #go/book What goes into making good libraries
	- A programming language is a tool. The more the tool can do, the more helpful it theoretically is. If the capabilities do not feel good to use, or are brittle, in otherwords, not designed well, then you dont really have a tool that is that useful. A good example is a utility knife that has every extension imaginable. Theoretically you could start a campfire, saw through a log, etc. But matches are much easier to use, a longer saw does the job much faster. A good tool understands how it would be used. The developer of a library has the challenging job of understanding how a developer would use the library, anticipating what the developer would reach for next. Types go a long way in communicating how to interface with the methods and services of a library. What about errors? I love coming across code where I have no idea if it throws an error, left as an exercise for the user I guess. If libraries are compiled assets or transpiled source, the library has lost some incredible power it could have offered the user. Source code is obscured, potential learning/exposure to another style of coding is thwarted. Debugging becomes difficult, no source code to slap breakpoints on to find root cause and report more context to the author. Optimizations are harder
