- so if we talk about the things that we are talking about now. Testing testing in the microphone is only one no I try talking to hello this is me talking in the microphone. I just wasn’t angle of my face.
  Bullet point Dash
  – hello sweet that’s pretty cool I wonder how many things have a school is as were talking I can go in and edit it
- I can pull up Google docs on here yeah yeah like live record into this. It was cool it’s all as we’re talking but I get really really fucking stone is we can say #blog and now if I were to push this to my CACD for notes this would turn into a blog post. Oh shit and so this is essentially what I’m saying blog semantically important tag that now as a special action associated with it, I think this would work really well for when you’re alone the struggle to people split things by person so in reality what we want to be doing is record on mic which logs I can do I can do a voice recording and in stores because just files on the Internet so I can tape it if I do the audio recording, and then I say #BlogItShouldBeSmartEnoughToTakeThatAudioRecordingEntranceToDoTheTranscriptWith  ABlogPostWhereIt’sLikeChrisAndFreeRoamMaybeATrainerOnWhatYourVoiceSoundsLike
- kudu finding a model and can differentiate voices on Spotify them Bonsack auto text run open whisper whisper on message to split audio tracks by person leave the gaps and then you can use a bit of it. Every time someone talks the timestamp of when they talk and then you could use the timestamp to chronologically insert the statement, that would work no I’ll be sick so like and then other application I’m thinking two is like if we’re doing an interview I can say like #[[QuestionAndThenThatWillHaveLikeThatCouldHaveLikeASpecialFormatAppliedToMyQuestionyeah cause I prep and now it’s like if I were to generate the east Gmail for this shit like Stanzel ]]
