=======
- contextualizing vulnerabilities with CWEs
	- collect information about a service
		- what dependencies are being used?
		- what are those dependencies commonly used for?
		- is this a frontend app or a backend app?
		- where does the app run? linux server? windows server?
	- using this contextual information prioritize vulnerabilities accordingly
		- if the vulnerability only affects window systems, and the app is deployed to a linux container...
- adding static analysis results to build view
	- https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/issues/966
- fixing bug where wrong package shows up as parent to another package
	- the root edge '0000-00...' can exist multiple times in a tree, and will get overwritten multiple times when the maps and sets are being created https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/issues/971
- it looks like the site goes down when a large repo is being loaded?
	- possibly the backend trying to do too much with loading the tree?
