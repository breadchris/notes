	- I want to combine some of the most commonly used apps that I use
		- apps
			- voice recorder -> for audio
			- chatgpt -> AI reasoning
			- logseq -> quick textual notes
			- omnivore -> read content that I have saved
				- it is hard to take notes with this
		- I want all of this to work offline and sync when the phone comes back online
- #protoflow/ideas
	- generate boilerplate code based off of node and edge type definitions
		- makes it super easy to save stuff when the code is generated
