- what is your definition of a successful relationship?
	- when you can share anything that is on your mind and know that the other person will accept what you are saying no matter what. this can be hard at times, but a successful relationship will be patient with each other’s thoughts and feelings because there is trust that each other knows that healing needs to take place before an idea can move forward. Conversations that are focused around feelings instead of the way that things are/have happened will keep a relationship alive because feelings are who we are, our honest selves.

- dependency graph
	- how can the graph be extended to allow multiple data sources seamlessly?
		- add attributes to a node while it is being loaded via a loader
		- dependency tree accepts a list of loaders which transforms accepted type of manifest edge
	- iterate over all manifest parent child relationships add them to graph
	- load vulnerabilities
		- determine if vulnerability is ignored
		- meets minimum security level
	- if a node has a vulnerability
	- for every vulnerable node, calculate shortest paths between root and vulnerable node
	- for every package release
		- associate with determined vulnerable dependency chains
