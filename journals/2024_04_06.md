	- Our brains are good at pattern matching (ref). When we see patterns in front of us, it is easy for our brains to factor out the common patterns, and we are left with the structure of how those patterns relate to each other. When you are programming, you are using common code constructs all the time; for loops, function signatures, maps, string concatenation, etc. On a high level this is what we are doing constantly while programming, but if you compare how you wrote some code compared to someone else in the same language, it often looks quite different. Why is that?
	- Just as easy as it is to remember patterns, we can repeat those patterns. It is the path of least resistence
