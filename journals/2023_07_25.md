	- **For the past 7 years, 200 students from around Montgomery County, Maryland participate in an NCIS-style cyber forensics investigation [1]. NYU’s CSAW High School Forensics had hosted this competition for a decade, nation-wide, for a decade before it came to an unfortunate end. The competition, when it ran, both attracted and excelled cyber security talent from early ages. Many of the competition’s alumni working in very prestigious cyber institutions, if not founders of cyber security companies themselves. Running this competition has historically required much work in order to organize and put it together. By creating the xctf [2] platform with our learnings for running this every year, it has become a battle-tested framework for not just improving the quality of the competition, but also reducing the operational cost. Our vision is to build a system so that any cyber security educator in the US is capable of running their own competition locally, while only requiring access to the Internet. **
