	- Code that is generated for a function should be associated with a block via an ID and path
	- ie. the name is used to wire up the code on "generate", and subsequent refactoring of the name should be aware of existing files as to not add a bunch of different functions on every node rename
		- id: 1
		- name: Some Function
		- path: /project/functions/somefunction

It seems if I try to simply recreated chatgpt, but with the UI that I have in my head (with the tree of context) people might be interested in using it.
