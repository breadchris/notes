- interesting security tool that looks like a sandbox for your application: https://medium.com/intrinsic-blog/securing-node-js-applications-with-intrinsic-db47ff86cff8
- development has shifted from building code yourself to relying on existing tools to bootstrap productivity 
- more developers that develop on more decentralized projects (contracting, small companies) has accelerated library development as common bootstrapping tasks are factored out and effort is shared
- this does two things
	- creates a culture around dependency reliance (answers to questions are a simple install away)
	- dependencies lose quality over time as there is no owner who is getting paid (this is changing as open source becomes a viable way to make a living, but react is owned by facebook and is undeniably one of the best javascript libraries)
- side effect: more unknown developers, who aren't getting paid, are writing code for your company
- there is little to no incentive, aside from popularity, community trust, for a package author to truly care about package compromises and response to vulnerabilities when they are not getting financial support 
	- how many package maintainers have families? a busy full time job? on vacation?
	- humans write this code that your company uses
