{"text": " Hello, this is the second episode of High Thinkies. My thoughts coming at you as they're coming at me. So Alex and I were talking about cybersecurity-related things and what the hell were we thinking about? I forget what it was. But I said, okay, so I had this idea. So I just got finished watching this incredible video that I guess I'll leave in the text below. But this video was talking about the history of VRChat and I did not know just how deep VRChat went. It's absolutely incredible. People have programmed so much and the marketplace is so large. I wonder if high schools have VR club and our kids are learning how to program and post a fun VR and play the game in such a elaborate detail, but this video is so worth watching. It's incredible. And it had me think of building a VR world for CTF players or other types of hackers. I don't know what it would look like, but because interacting in a virtual world isn't really easy for programming. But I don't know, maybe there's something clever, maybe you can make a matrix universe and give people excited about it, excited about hacking. But yeah, anyway, it's high-thinkings for today.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.36, "text": " Hello, this is the second episode of High Thinkies.", "tokens": [50364, 2425,
