- for github pages, it is [required to have a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the root of the domain that points to `<username>.github.io` google domains does not let you do this, you should use [cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) instead of google's dns
