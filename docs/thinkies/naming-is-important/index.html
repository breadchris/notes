I am the only one developing this right now, so naming shouldn’t matter as much. When explaining justshare to people I would say “You share content with a provider, like your email or twitter”. It is very functional, I think it is obvious how the system works, but it isn’t very fun.

This is what I have so far:\nFind or make a thing. You want to share some thing with someone. It could be a file, a link, a note, or another thing.\nShare it with people. You want to share it with someone. You could share it with a friend, a group of friends, or the whole world. You want to put a thing in a place. heh.\nControl who gets to see it. You want to control who gets to see it. Just for you. Just for your friends. Just for your friends and their friends. Just for the whole world.\nYour thing is valuable. You want to know who sees it. You want to know who likes it. You want to know who shares it. You want to know who comments on it. You want to know who makes a copy of it. You want to know who makes a derivative of it. You want to know who makes a derivative of a derivative of it. You want to know who makes a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of it. You want to know who makes a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of it.\nFind and update your thing later. When you want to share that thing again, it is effortless to find. Anyone who you have shared it with sees changes you make.\nHave any thoughts? I would love to hear them.\n",
