	- Heated and dramatic exchange between Claire and Leroux at the top of a building. Claire is upset with him that he took full credit for the boucheron bakery kidnapper case and did not acknowledge the involvement of anyone else at the company. He tries to calm her down but she pushes him off the building. Here is the transcript.
		- **[The Scene: The rooftop of a downtown building, the city skyline stretching into the distance. The air is tense as Claire confronts Leroux, her face a mixture of anger and betrayal.]**
		- **Claire:** (Furiously) How could you, Leroux? After everything we've been through on the Boucheron Bakery case, you just take all the credit?
		- **Leroux:** (Attempting to soothe) Claire, please, let's talk about this calmly. I understand you're upset, but—
		- **Claire:** (Interrupting) Upset? Upset doesn't even begin to cover it! We worked as a team, and you just erased all our efforts with one speech!
		- **Leroux:** (Placating) I know, I know. It was a mistake, an oversight in the heat of the moment. I can fix this, Claire.
		- **Claire:** (Sarcastically) An oversight? Is that what you call it? Because from where I'm standing, it looks a lot like betrayal.
		- **Leroux:** (Desperately) I didn't mean to undermine anyone. I—I was just caught up in the moment. You know how these things go, Claire.
		- **Claire:** (Bitterly) No, I don't know, Leroux. Because while you're basking in the glory, the rest of us are left in the shadows, forgotten.
		- **Leroux:** (Reaching out) Claire, please, let me make it right. We can go back, hold a press conference, and I'll make sure everyone knows the truth.
		- **Claire:** (Pulling away) It's too late for that. The damage is done. You've shown your true colors, Leroux.
		- **Leroux:** (Desperate) I'm begging you, Claire. Don't let this ruin everything we've built. We can get past this, together.
		- **Claire:** (Firmly) No, Leroux. We can't. I won't work with someone who has so little regard for his team.
		- **Leroux:** (Pleading) Claire, please—
		- **[In a sudden burst of anger, Claire shoves Leroux forcefully. He stumbles backward, losing his balance, and falls off the building, disappearing from view as Claire looks on, horror-stricken by her own actions.]**
		- **[The scene ends with Claire standing alone on the rooftop, the weight of her actions and the silence around her marking the gravity of the moment.]**
