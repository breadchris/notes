- im really interested in driving down the complexity of using kubernetes because I think it is the most significant advancement in deployment in the past decade, but people are scared to approach it because of its complexity. there is actually a really interesting story there too, the team that made kubernetes used to work at docker, but they had a vision and it didnt align with docker so they left (i think). Docker tried to make docker swarm happen, but dropped the ball, kubes is obviously what it is today, but is not intuitive like docker-compose is. So we now have this rift between docker local dev experience, and kubernetes deployment magic, and kompose is trying to bridge that gap, and does so pretty damn well imo. What is nice is that it generates a helm chart for you so when you want to eject, you just stop using kompose and you have all your kubes resources.
