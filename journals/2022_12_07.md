		- Query all opened PRs for their status
			- did the build work?
			- what are the other events that have happened on the PR?
				- comments from devs
				- bots running
		- Show a percent completed code changes, show the ones that are still pending
	- SEO
		- figure out how to go from one version of a library to another
