- #lunabrain/work
	- fixing spacing between bar and content
		- too much space
	- Content wants to exist within a domain, and referenced by a path
		- multiple paths can reference the same content
		- a path is a "tag"
		- a domain is a "group"
		- in this system
	- I want it to be easier for people to save things
		- need to get the extension functioning
		- instructions for setting it up via dev setup
	- I want to have my logseq stuff show up as a source of information I can look through
		- I really want to be able to swipe through it
	- #lunabrain/sources Sources are places where content can come from
		- YouTube channel
		- knowledge graph w/ datalog query
	- I want to have a prompt content type that you can set a go template for so that you can run a base prompt with some inputs
		- I am tired of typing out the same prompt over and over

		- add source content to a group

		- when the source is
- #protoflow/work
	- protoflow is going to help accelerate service driven development. If you think about every action your app might do as a method of a service, you can quickly iterate on an interface (defined with protobuf) which immediately glues your frontend and backend together. From there, you can have deeper integration with code gen (generating backend code/frontend components) which can serve as a POC for that new feature you want to add. The code gen can be driven by AI, which is aware of the stack you are using (I find myself constantly typing "Write me a typescript, react, fluentui, component that does..." or "Write me a go function that does...")
- #seattle/coffee-shops
	- The Living Room Cafe
		- https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ijizM2oegzT2Szs5
		- Connected to a typical seattle copy and paste apartment complex
		- While the reviews are high, I would not rate this place high
		- Nice cafe aesthetic, but in a manufactured kind of way vs an organic cafe vibe. You should check it out if you are in the area.
