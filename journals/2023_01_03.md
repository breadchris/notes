- taking notes #blog/ideas
	- i need to get writing down thoughts and ideas i think
	- idk how to share my passion in word
	- take observations and transform them into user stories
	- which become tasks and then protoflow blocks
	- note taking needs to be more effortlesslv expressive and that's what Al can do
	- dalle to generate images
	- gpt to summarize content
	- that missing layer that
	- are feeling is what i want
	- i have so much information that i consume that I don't let tabs stay open for longer than a day in my browser
	- if it's still open a day later it gets saved in logsed with a few notes as to what it is and why i had it opened
	- and then it gets closed
	- it makes me more realistic in what i can get to in any given day
	- Â¡keep tabs open because i think i will get some new insight that I haven't made yet, which is probably true, but i have so many goddar insights i haven't acted on
	- vou read when vou are researching, you write when you are developing. realistically, you can't do both at the same time if you want to be as effective as you can be. you put in the work up front so that when you sit down to do one or the other you make it happen.
	- hmm 6m
	- the idea of a "contract" embodies this principle
	- you do your research up front so you can write a contract, and then with bounds defined, the world
	- a poorly written contract will distract you from doing what you want, because you are second guessing yourself 5m V obviously reading=research and writing=development is not absolute (ex. reading documentation) but when i think about the times that I am slowed down when doing things in my life, it's typically the result of a poorly written
	- "contract" because people didn't put in the work up front or learnings from development were not factored into the revision of a contract effectively
