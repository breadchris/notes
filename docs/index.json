Humans all have this incredible biological computer sitting inside their head and if you treat it as just that, a computer, it can do cool things. But in order for the computer to run at optimal capacity, there are some conditions you have to meet. Our bodies are constantly sending signals to us asking us to drink water, eat food, go for a walk. Whether we listen is another story. The western world does not put much emphasis on the development of intuition, as opposed to the cultural values of the east.\nYoga is not just a practice of stretching and strengthening your muscles, it also gives you an opportunity to develop an intuition about what your body is telling you. Can you stretch in that direction? No? What if you breath into it, what does your body tell you now. I am consistently surprised with just how much I can push myself in yoga by just focusing on the simple act of being and connecting with my body.\nBeing aware of what your body is telling you branches into all aspects of your life. You are you after all. Knowing when work can wait so that you can take time for things that feel more worth your time so that your body will thank you later is indispensable.\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/blog/connecting-your-body-and-your-mind/","summary":"If someone were to talk to me about connecting my body to my mind a decade ago, I would have thought they were full of it.

Patch on patch of this form has left this code in disarray. This code is actually quite important to this site as well. It is a general application form that leverages the power of Protobuf\u0026rsquo;s expressive type system to generate a form a user can interact with. I have some ideas for where I want to take this code, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t been a priority. The form worked well enough, until it didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nI went to use the form today to try to enter in some information and I encountered a problem. If a map was referenced in the form, it would not save properly due to how the data was being serialized and sent:\n```\n{ \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some key\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some value\u0026rdquo; }\n```\nshould have been\n```\n{ \u0026ldquo;some key\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some value\u0026rdquo; }\n```\nBecause of how this code was written, there was not a strong separation of concerns, which was a concern. Since this is a bug that is stopping a critical flow through this app, I had to resolve it. There were 2 options: tack on another patch or rewrite it sanely. When I code, I have shifted over the years to favor the former. When you can afford to write a patch, it is usually faster to implement and you can keep things moving. Just make sure you leave notes along the way, future you will thank you. Additionally, writing a patch doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop you from rewriting. It is possible that by going through the exercise of adding the patch, you are able to load enough of the code into your head to more efficiently rewrite the code.\nI started with attempting a patch. I am currently the sole developer of this codebase and so far patches to this form have been able to get me by. Reading through the code to track down the problem, I realized just how deep the problem is rooted. To patch on a solution would be more of a dirty, dirty hack to get it working. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother thinking all the way through how I would have gotten it working because of how complicated it seemed. The stars had aligned to give this code a proper rewrite.\nI rewrote this code to be as functional and generic as possible so that it could be reused for different purposes. It has been a while since I have as proud as I was to write this function. I felt myself tapping into some distant knowledge I had on functional ocaml as I wrote this. The solution was elegant and exactly what I needed. Opting for the rewrite was not free, it took time. The trade of time for this code was well worth taking and future me will be very grateful.\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/blog/what-is-a-good-refactoring-task/","summary":"There has been a part of this code that I have been wanting to refactor for a while.

In my opinion, we all do interesting things. In order to communicate the interesting things that we do, we need to provide others with an immersive experience of our world.

Yet, more restrictive social media sites, twitter, youtube, facebook, reign supreme.\nI think there is a fine balance between sites that give you all the freedom in the world to create and sites that have some requirements. Maybe the solution is something that is more hybrid. You can have building blocks of content, a timeline of tweets, videos, etc. but the content is anything that you could dream of. Like a universal file uploader _and_ formatter.

You could argue that the world is more vulnerable than it has ever been, as a whole, because of the shear amount of technology that exists. The thing that has shifted security has been the \u0026ldquo;juicy targets\u0026rdquo; requiring more and more time to hack. Less people are trying to hack banks because there are actually a number of protections that exist. These checks don\u0026rsquo;t stop someone from committing fraud, that is still super easy, but they stop attacks en masse.

They operate where the interface meets the implementation. They will understand things that no one in their right mind should understand.

I have spent a lot of time doing cyber security, I have spent a lot of time coding, maybe if I am lucky I could be a baker from all the time I have spent baking. But there is only so much time in the day. There are only so many things that you can get 10,000 hours of mastery over. And even if you have \u0026ldquo;mastered\u0026rdquo; it, have you felt good doing it? My attention wanders a lot during the day. \u0026ldquo;Why did those eggs stick the pan?\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;What if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to write code in Javascript?\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;Maybe I want to play some guitar now.\u0026rdquo; It is hard to narrow in on what exactly I should do, let alone what I want to do. But, if you treat life like a game, you can start to come up with answers that are more \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; than others.\nYou are just gamifying your life. Your life goals are just the things in your video game that you are trying to achieve. Setting goals for yourself is quite tricky, especially at a time when there are so many goals that you could be setting. Maybe you want to do what your friend is doing, maybe you want to learn that thing you saw on Instagram, or maybe you will get into yoga this year. You can do a lot of things, but the choice is crippling. I think most people are paralyzed by the options and end up choosing none. There are no perfect life goals to set, they are different for everyone.

My life didn\u0026rsquo;t feel satisfying unless I had learned some type of \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo;. I was jealous of people I saw on Youtube who could lay down crazy bass licks, all the while feeling completely incapable of playing simple songs. But the jealously slowly turned into realization. These people have spent ungodly hours on this instrument to be able to play like that. Even if I had happened to have picked up this instrument when I was they did, what are the odds that I would still be playing today?\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t just need time to practice, you need energy. You need intrinsic motivation that pushes you through the point where any normal person would stop, and then you continue to break through. To me, someone who practices that is an \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; and it applies to anything. I think people think I am crazy when I say this but I tell them anyways \u0026ldquo;a janitor could be into the art of cleaning!\u0026rdquo; And why not? Maybe they janitor with such passion that it would make an Olympian look like they perform half-heartedly. Maybe the odds are low on that one, but hopefully you see my point. I started to rethink some things I thought about myself.\nI though programming was too nerdy. I had spent a lot of my life being \u0026ldquo;too nerdy\u0026rdquo; meaning I answered questions in class or spent too long explaining things I was passionate about, I guess. And typical judgement on nerds is that they aren\u0026rsquo;t valuable to be around, maybe their existence is so oppressive that you need to beat them up, who knows. This fear of judgement led me to always distance myself somewhat from coding. It was a means to an end. The job I would do to \u0026ldquo;become successful\u0026rdquo; by working 9 to 5 at a job that I will complain about every day, and realize there is no fixing the crippling problems of the company.\nSo I made programming my art. I decided it was the thing that I would spend an ungodly amount of time thinking about and doing.\nI am so far down a rabbit hole, maybe this is somewhat coherent. If not, I am not sorry.
