	- #lunabrain/wants I don't want to reinvent a note taking system. I want to take sources of things, like my notes, and then synthesize observations into published works.
		- It might be that I have some of my notes
	- For the current day, I want to add a 100DaysToOffload tag to logseq from lunabrain
