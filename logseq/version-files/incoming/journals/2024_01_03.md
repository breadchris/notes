	- I just heard some annoying news today. Months ago, a contracting position my friend and I were looking forward to working on was presented to us. The company and work sounded like a perfect match for our skill sets. Today we found out that the work is not available to us. What took so long? A series of conversations and waiting. Reflecting on this process, we did not push for signatures on papers and let the unfulfilled promises continue to keep us on the line. We passed up on other opportunities like applying for YC for this potential work. We made it clear our intentions with them as we were hoping this would turn into a full time position.
	- I am not crying here. I am not whining. If it sounds like I am it is because my writing is poor. I want to take this as a lesson in how the business world works. The company we have been talking to doesn't owe us anything. That is the reality. But what they do own are their actions towards us, and they don't communicate respect. A brand that we have grown to respect is now tainted with our experience with them. This relationship is now strained and our perception has been changed.
	- Value yourself and push for what you believe you deserve.
