00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
I guess we're gonna try to record this thought with a regular mic so I guess you

00:10.640 --> 00:20.840
could listen to this as kind of like a podcast all right I guess I guess this is

00:20.840 --> 00:30.720
the official high-pinkies podcast because effectively what I can do if this

00:30.720 --> 00:38.840
audio is embedded in my site is I can link this to hashtag high-pinkies and I could

00:38.840 --> 00:46.240
put that out there so isn't hasn't logsec effectively made the perfect

00:46.240 --> 00:58.120
podcasting platform because I could just record my thoughts and I could listen to

00:58.120 --> 01:08.760
them back someone else could listen to them back maybe I have the the GitHub

01:08.760 --> 01:16.960
like the script thing where I can turn speech into text but if I have that set

01:16.960 --> 01:28.400
up then I can I can go back and turn turn my the audio that I'm saying until

01:28.400 --> 01:37.080
like the perfect yeah the perfect podcasting platform I don't see why this

01:37.080 --> 01:49.640
wouldn't work and actually you know what I can do is I could just record a

01:49.640 --> 01:57.840
video so if I I wonder how well this would work if I just wanted to if I could

01:57.840 --> 02:03.160
sync my phone with my remarkable then I could just take out a sheet of

02:03.160 --> 02:10.440
paper right effectively that's what I'd be doing and writing down my notes and

02:10.440 --> 02:16.500
that could effectively screencast right because you can set up a VNC

02:16.500 --> 02:22.740
server on a remarkable you could screencast to your phone like I need to

02:22.740 --> 02:30.040
figure out if you can do video or if it's feasible to do video recording over

02:30.040 --> 02:38.880
VNC I guess you have to be connected the same local network which is fine I

02:38.880 --> 02:47.120
mean you're probably on your home Wi-Fi network or if you're walking around I

02:47.120 --> 02:52.600
think maybe you could do like a mobile hotspot

02:52.600 --> 03:01.920
to connect to and then maybe you're remarkable I guess I need to figure out if you

03:01.920 --> 03:15.960
have your iPhone connected or set up as a hotspot can your phone talk to can it

03:15.960 --> 03:33.000
talk to I'm trying a blank yeah right okay right if you have a mobile hotspot

03:33.000 --> 03:39.440
can your phone connect to another device that is shared on the mobile hotspot I

03:39.440 --> 03:47.000
guess is what I'm saying so like as I'm talking right I can talk I can have my

03:47.000 --> 03:52.680
words roughly translated into text right at least like the the words that are

03:52.680 --> 03:59.240
if they're nonsense you can click on that word and it will take you to that point

03:59.240 --> 04:08.440
in time in the audio and then I could also write if I wanted to just stream my

04:08.440 --> 04:13.680
notes taking right because I have the remarkable I can take out my remarkable I

04:13.680 --> 04:20.520
can have it be running a VNC server for that my phone connects to right because

04:20.520 --> 04:23.640
they're on the same local network and they should be able to find each other and

04:23.640 --> 04:29.480
then I just record that as a video and then I also insert that into lock set

04:29.480 --> 04:37.120
because it can just reference notes so in the repo there would like for this

04:37.120 --> 04:46.480
entry there would be the audio there would be the playback text which in lock

04:46.480 --> 04:52.000
set mobile you wouldn't be able to see but you could write a plug-in right on the

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
desktop that

05:11.000 --> 05:20.560
damn why am I doing a blank plug-in on the desktop that would

05:22.560 --> 05:27.240
run as

05:30.840 --> 05:45.280
JS that would hopefully this doesn't sound completely okay here and because this is

05:45.280 --> 05:50.720
for sure this is like I guess that's the whole point of the high think he's

05:50.720 --> 05:58.720
broadcast is that it's literally going to sound ridiculous and that's what

05:58.720 --> 06:08.360
makes I think he's special you just record yourself thinking

06:08.360 --> 06:22.000
yeah anyway I hope I'm able to listen to this back and I guess no I don't need

06:22.000 --> 06:25.240
to listen to this back because I wanted to try to develop this because

06:25.240 --> 06:31.040
theoretically I think he's with even with massive gaps the text that you read

06:31.040 --> 06:38.480
would be different like you could just zoom around to the parts that interest you

06:38.480 --> 06:43.120
so if I start talking about cooking right I could rattle off like an

06:43.120 --> 06:49.640
ingredient recipe for example like like if I could speak naturally and I could

06:49.640 --> 06:57.200
say to make a pie crust right and so or I just like say the words like new

06:57.200 --> 07:14.840
recipe pie crust one part flour one part butter then a little bit of salt and if

07:14.840 --> 07:26.680
I'm still here still just thinking so I would say change and

07:27.200 --> 07:50.560
I would say change and then I would change the recipe step so for example I would

07:50.560 --> 08:09.280
change the recipe step two what you would call it oh I would change the first

08:09.280 --> 08:26.280
recipe step of pie crust to be combined flour salt sugar in bowl which would

08:26.280 --> 08:32.080
then like mark that as the step and then for the second one right I would say on

08:32.080 --> 08:41.840
this like podcast thing you like you tag it right so it's like I said the word I'm

08:41.840 --> 08:44.840
just going to say we're in a word right Harvard I don't know why I'm taking

08:44.840 --> 08:52.320
hard but I say Harvard and I pronounced it clearly enough that it added the tag

08:52.320 --> 09:06.000
Harvard you could then create a whole page that is like the Grap Results of a whole

09:06.000 --> 09:15.240
page in Logsack that is like the Grap Results of me saying Harvard right I search

09:15.240 --> 09:23.160
through all these like text documents right because that's what this audio would turn

09:23.160 --> 09:29.560
into right it would turn into a text document and it wouldn't be perfect but it's like good

09:29.560 --> 09:35.800
enough right the conversion be good enough that I could go back through everything that

09:35.800 --> 09:47.120
I've said right all my notes on something and recall them so for example let's just like

09:47.120 --> 09:56.880
what's the stupid example of this like I say the word balloon right I say the word right

09:56.880 --> 10:04.480
now and then maybe tomorrow right maybe tomorrow I go to a circus for whatever reason and

10:04.480 --> 10:11.600
at the circus they have balloons right so this would be the second entry into my note

10:11.600 --> 10:22.280
taking journal is balloons so now like through analysis of the text you can identify words

10:22.280 --> 10:30.040
or you put that into essentially your personal search engine which I'm going to see right

10:30.040 --> 10:36.260
so I have my notes up right now and I'm going to try to see if I can find this search engine

10:36.260 --> 10:53.560
that I saved because I saw it before but I don't quite know so basically if this thing I can

10:53.560 --> 11:13.080
definitely had it like somewhere search it was like index damn like so for example if so

11:13.080 --> 11:28.120
there's this tool that I have in mind if it was like really fast it was like really fast

11:28.120 --> 11:35.000
right so if I said like I'm reading hacker news right so I start my day and I just hit

11:35.000 --> 11:51.480
record right and I start talking and it's like talking about hacker news then then I would have

11:51.480 --> 11:58.560
this thought right of searching like I could then search for the tags like and maybe it works

11:58.560 --> 12:18.800
maybe maybe I can do that so search for say hacker news and it was thinking about search now see if

12:18.800 --> 12:23.760
when I saved that article as browsing the internet and I saved that article if it did text extraction

12:23.760 --> 12:33.360
because right this is what I want to do this is the whole point of 50 is I can make it trivial like in

12:33.360 --> 12:53.360
like a an API call a single API call I could turn a holy shit this could be huge like I could just

12:53.360 --> 13:06.080
fork log sec right could I just fork log sec

13:06.080 --> 13:26.240
I don't know is it like a hacker news and then search now index goddamn what was it maybe I can go

13:26.240 --> 13:35.120
online it's very usually so I can leave my note now oh my god this is so funny my face didn't

13:35.600 --> 13:41.840
cool type sensor that's a note now if I wanted to right I could tag it because it right it took

13:41.840 --> 13:50.480
me so long to put this in right because that way I can search things from oh it's not called

13:50.560 --> 13:56.960
hacker news it's called white combinator but I remember it in my head is hacker news right so and I'm

13:56.960 --> 14:09.200
going to take this note right now and I'm going to say hashtag we'll say hashtag what's what I want to

14:09.200 --> 14:24.560
say oh no I guess this is like I think he's going to link it to the page I think he is

14:24.560 --> 14:45.600
whoops I come on I think he's that page cool

14:45.600 --> 14:58.160
right so this thing and this is the right and if I had this this fucking the title of the page and I

14:58.160 --> 15:09.360
wouldn't have to copy it all this shit down so annoying oh my goodness

15:09.360 --> 15:28.080
it's not quite organized the way that I wanted to oh well be like close enough maybe

15:39.680 --> 15:45.920
I think it's working hopefully

15:45.920 --> 16:02.160
so I'm going on this train of thought I guess maybe I'll stop here see what happens
