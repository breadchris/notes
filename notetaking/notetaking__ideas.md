### browser workspaces as notes
where you use a browser window to browse the internet, click open links, do your research. When you are done for the night, or want to context switch, you click a button to consolidate all of your open tabs into a single note. From there you can take notes on the saved links for future reference as well as context switch back to your browser session to resume your research. The note could be formatted in such a way that you can distinguished "opened" vs "closed" tabs:
```
# opened
- google.com
- wikipedia.org

# closed
- discord.gg
- instagram.com
```
