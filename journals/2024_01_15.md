	- ([2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt6NME0k9E&t=162s)) QUAD SET: a simple, sustained contraction to the quadriceps muscle to increase strength and voluntary firing.
	- ([3:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt6NME0k9E&t=223s)) STRAIGHT LEG RAISE: adding hip flexion to the quad contraction is an effective way to strengthen the knee.
	- ([4:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt6NME0k9E&t=295s)) SHORT ARC QUAD: adding slight flexion and contracting the quad into terminal extension can be an effective means of strengthening as well as getting the knee joint used to moving again.
	- ([5:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt6NME0k9E&t=359s)) BRIDGES: Great way to increase glute and hamstring strength without introducing potentially painful motion at the knee.
	- ([7:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt6NME0k9E&t=430s)) SIDELYING HIP ABDUCTION: arguably the most important hip muscle in terms of knee health and biomechanics.
