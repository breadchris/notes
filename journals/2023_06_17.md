	- type generation works now if you have blocks connected to another block
	- need to figure out why there are duplicate types that end up in the generated code
	- need to build buttons for the custom blocks which will generate the implementation or infer the types and write the code
		- basically this means breaking up the global build button so that blocks can be build individually
	- how can we build functions if there are multiple parents into a block?
		- https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jhump/protoreflect@v1.15.1/desc/builder
		- seems promising
- #blog/ideas Protoflow
	- Data
		- Free formed data
		- Data with a loose schema
			- json
		- Data with a rigid schema
			- Protobuf
	- A Composable Function
		- Code transforms data into other data
	- Resources
		- Code can't run on its own, it needs to belong to a resource.
		- Types
			- Language Service
			- Blob
			- Docstore
			- RDS
			- Pub/Sub
			- Runtime Configuration
			- Secrets
		- Good code abstraction for resources https://gocloud.dev/
		- Deployment
			- https://tilt.dev
			- Development
				- virtualization is the bane of local development
				- Binaries and scripts
				- docker-compose
			- Production
				- Kubernetes is preferable
	- Workflow
		- Workflows compose a resource's functions together so that data can be conducted into moving in a desirable way.
