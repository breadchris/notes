	- two big nice to have efforts
		- tailwindcss+daisyui
		- entgo?
			- is this the right decision?
			- I think the database models can be chopped down a bit
	- transcription UI
		- take conversation and process it
	- flow
		- upload an audio file
		- transcription is set as related content
	- need to move transcription code to write to a transcription
		- a file has the related content of a transcript
		- viewing the transcript, you can see the live version of it
			- POC observer lookup table based on content ID
	- transcript shows up
		- I also want to see the audio file
	- #lunabrain/code
		- ```typescript
		      switch (c.type.case) {
		          case 'data':
		              const d = c.type.value;
		              switch (d.type.case) {
		                  case 'text':
		                      return ;
		                  case 'file':
		                      return <span>{d.type.value.file}</span>
		                  case 'url':
		                      return <ContentCard item={item} setChecked={setChecked} />;
		              }
		              break;
		      }
