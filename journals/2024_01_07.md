	- Met someone at a cafe today who does mobile app distribution. Wasn't familiar with the title, but it made sense when he explained it. He is running the numbers behind the in-app mobile advertisements or social media posts advertising a mobile game. There was a lot of new information that I learned about this area of work, including some tools like [SensorTower](https://sensortower.com/).
	- We got into the work that I was doing and it was refreshing to get his perspective. Taking a look at the data around the performance of productivity tools on the app market made it clear that to be a top grossing app in this space, you basically need AI in the title. So many of the apps were just clones of the ChatGPT app, pretty wild.
	- He brought up [Opal](https://www.opal.so/) as an example of a good app. The data that it is showing you is already on your phone, it is just making the metrics more accessible and actually blocks the apps from being opened. The monetization is straight forward; premium features which go beyond the free ones, such as reoccurring focus times for blocking certain apps.
	- The biggest take away that I had was that building something that surfaces

	- got parsing markdown from notes working
	- need to sync this up with interface

		- how do you identify the latest content from the logseq source?
			- there are different sources of information
				- the database
				- logseq notes
				- twitter
				- youtube
				- etc.
	- make a logseq source where you can view synced notes from a directory
