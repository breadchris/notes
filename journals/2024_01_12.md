	- I have notes from different "circles of trust"
		- how do I store them securely so I get privacy
	- i want to record meetings, but still respect people's privacy
	- added table for searching for posts to post to site
		- need to differentiate which posts end up in different locations?
	- working on the interface a bit

- #100DaysToOffload More users, more problems, more learning.
	- So I did a [stream yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/live/FafcWFitxmQ?si=SW6ghTckNcgVLYYh&t=4918) which was pretty interesting. I was hosting a chat app I wrote into LunaBrain for the stream. It was pretty cool to see the chat getting engagement, people sending messages into the ephemeral ether of a chat with no persistent storage. But of course, a chat with no verified accounts spells disaster. There were many profanities being sent into the chat, so much so I had to take the chat offline to try to patch what was going on. At the same time, because I was bolting this onto an existing app, there were some problems I anticipated that were coming to light. See, I was doing live development of the chat app, meaning I was routing https://breadchris.ngrok.io to my local computer. This is not a problem in itself, I did not have any sensitive information in the app, nor was there any way for arbitrary file read, write, execution possible (I do have some confidence in my hacked together code). There was, however, open registration and having a user account on LunaBrain means that you get to play with all the fun experimental features, which I didn't want people messing with. The result was me blocking registration on the fly. The person who was messing with this also realized that they could send messages to me not just from the chat, but also in the error logs of the app running. This made development difficult, since I wanted to catch errors as I was writing code in the console. I did not come up with a good solution for this annoyance during the stream, but I had thought about some ideas (filtering of logs based on user session?)
	- While there were some annoying parts, live coding like this was really invigorating. Having someone trying to "hack" you as you "hack" them back is such a fun experience. While the stakes were incredibly low, I think that there is something to this idea that I want to explore further in future streams.
	- After this stream, I feel pretty confident that I want to make the purpose of the stream to be building the chat for the stream. I want this chat to be configurable out the ass with some potentially unhinged options that can make it super engaging. From the people messing around with it, I learned that I really need to think about the various ways that you can gate access to the chat, but still driving engagement. I think this will be really fun, and rewarding to build so I'll be giving it a go!
