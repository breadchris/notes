	- still need to get database backup working
	- going to focus on
- #lunabrain/work
	- #lunabrain/wants I want to finish the video clipper so that I can send great content to people.
		- I think you need to upload the video to lunabrain, and then have a follow up action where the video is clipped
			- possibly introduce new type: timestamps?
			- just parse text content applied to a video for #clips
				- easiest
	- #lunabrain/wants I want to nail the idea of a daily journal
