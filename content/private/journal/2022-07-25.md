- improve logging https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/pull/796 
	- make sure buildId is being surfaced when possible for better tracability

### What do we need in order for us to feel happy using our own tool
- automatic PRs
	- When a vulnerability is detected, and it can be trivially updated, a PR should be made
	- The PR will run a build and if it passes will provide a reasonable level of certainty that the code changes are valid
- CVSS environmental score adjustment
	- Vulnerabilities should be adjusted based on the importance of the service that it was found in
		- For a monorepo this can be difficult, but letting someone configure a path for where their service lies, we could see what packages in the package.json are used by that service

### What lies ahead
- One button security button
	- Update dependencies based on what versions are available and what constraints are reported in package lock
		- Create a PR automatically for someone to approve and land
		- Ingest NPM packages and upsert them into the database
	- Run vulnerability upsert job on a schedule
- Reduce false positives
	- 'yarn why' view of a vulnerable package (is it a dev package?)
		- Use data from 
	- Semgrep identification of an imported package in a source file
		- CLI runner in the backend should be more robust to allow running arbituary CLI tools
		- Need to determine what the `finding` schema would look like to allow for generic findings to exists as well as specific types of findings
			- `generic` finding type that contains a `jsonb` and is validated with a protobuf definition?
			- Over time, you would _graduate_ findings types to have their own dedicated table
		- Figuring out what a framework for this would look like would be immensely helpful for using arbituary CLI tools before we formalize an offering that would produce validated results.
- license scanning
	- The code already exists, it just needs to run when packages are discovered
		- A `package-upsert` queue should exist that accepts a package name and ecosystem. The latest metadata should be collected and then upserted into our database.
