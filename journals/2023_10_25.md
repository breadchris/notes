		- You want to code with LEGOs, not Mega Blocks
		- Knowing what feels more "right" in code is an art, but
		- Legos
			- The first LEGO set I ever had came from Mcdonalds, probably one of the last toys you could get in a happy meal that had any redeeming quality
			- After I built it for the first time, I allegedly would walk around with it all the time
			- I would fall asleep with it
			- I noticed that these pieces didn't have to be arranged in the way I was told to do so by the instructions. I could build whatever I wanted.
			- I remember how deeply satisfying it was to arrange and rearrange this limited set of pieces   into whatever I could think of. With a little imagination a crude representation could become what I wanted it to be.
			- Buying and building LEGOs became a fixation for me. Turning a whole section of the basement into my lair filled with new sets, partially disassembled sets, and random pieces from eroded sets from years past.
			- I think my mom got me a Mega Blocks set once and somehow the pieces ended up in one of these bins. Whenever I was looting around for pieces and I came across these pieces, they would immediately throw them away. But even if a single LEGO piece was found laying around the house, I would pick it up and return it to the bin.
			- It is an honest mistake Mom, Mega Blocks look so similar to LEGOs why would I care so much?
			- I don't know if you have had a chance to play around LEGOs all that much, but they are a very special toy to me. LEGO year after year showed what was possible to build with their catalog of bricks and to me then, and now, it is mind blowing.
			- There are many design principles that keep LEGO being LEGO. And the brand has only ever faltered when they deviated from this set of design principles.
		- Building something simple
			- Is there a quintessential LEGO build, maybe a car/house?
			- For code, you might think of a TODO app
			- What could be simpler, and fundamentally helpful than displaying a list of things on a screen for someone to use a computer to help them keep track?
			- If you search "TODO MVC" you will find an endless number of projects, that all look quite different, trying to show you how to code this.
			- If you try to take the code for any one of these projects and put it in your own app, you will probably fail.
				- Dependencies will be out of date
				- They are incompatible
				- The code uses forgotten functions
			- If something as simple as a TODO app brings about this much complexity, does that feel like a LEGO brick you could use in your code?
			- With the explosion of open source software and packages that flying off the package registry's shelf, how can you tell which ones are more like LEGOs vs Mega Blocks?
		- Cooking
			- I like to cook
			- Following recipes can be challenging
			- I wanted to build a foundational piece of software that people could build upon to help people save and view recipes.
			- How would I do that?
			- Whenever something bothered me while following a recipe, I would take note of it and try to write code to fix it.
			- Because I wanted to improve how recipes felt when you followed them, I needed to build a solid front end
			- The last time I had really done this was with jQuery, and we all know how that goes
			- There are hard problems in software development, and building good websites is certainly one of them
			- Trying to rapidly prototype features in the site as I came across them in the real world was really fun, but also insanely frustrating
			- As a side project, there was no months of planning by an engineering team to discuss and agree upon the best way to build this. Changes came sporadically and were layered on top of my desperate attempts to try to get React to do the thing that I wanted it to.
			- After 7 attempts at trying to build it with countless different technologies, I arrived at an app that I still not happy with
