	- an analysis of different
- #freeqaz
	- We could literally use the OpenAI API and write a client which doesn't record the data (or scrubs it) and then probably make some solid $ with it
	- 14m
	- like literally just change [lunasec.io](http://lunasec.io) to be like "AI firewall"
	- 14m
	- It isn't crazy
	- 14m
	- and then a demo video
	- 14m
	- i honestly don't really want to build it
	- 13m
	- but I am curious from a business perspective how far an idea like that would go
	- 13m
	- and it isn't mutually exclusive from what we want to build
	- 13m
	- I wouldn't mind building a chat client for ChatGPT. That's pretty damn easy
	- 13m
	- That's effectively what we're discussing here
	- 12m
	- it would be boring if it was just that
	- 12m
	- but the underlying system you need to make that scale is interesting
	- 12m
	- Enterprise is always going to be boring
	- 12m
	- I would say that this is a top 3 security problem for orgs atm
	- 12m
	- we could probably build it
	- 6m
	- it would just kind of be annoying? idk
	- 6m
	- what does it look like? a prompt that takes input and removes sensitive information?
	- 6m
	- we store an audit log of what people have sent and received
	- 5m
	- i don't think it would be something I am passionate about to be honest
	- 4m
	- I think I would much rather be building something for people where I am helping them build
	- 4m
	- vs being on the other end and telling people they can't do certain things
	- 4m
	- I think our natural feelings are we want to make things as accessible to people as possible, and security doesn't want to innovate in that way
	- 3m
	- if we are building a security company, I think the product we are building will always be at odds with our ethos because of the nature of the market
	- 3m
	- like if I were to build a security product, I think the problem that would most interest me is secrets in code
	- 2m
	- there are still no companies that are doing it, and as a developer, it would be really fucking nice if I just had someplace I could put my secrets and it would just work
	- 2m
	- as I have realized by talking to people, my notetaking strategy is incredibly valuable and it is something people wish that they could do
	- 1m
	- that energy I have gotten from people is what I want to build a product for
	- i don't want to go through the same song and dance of the oppressive, reductive thinking that plagues security decisions made by middle management
- #javascript/libraries/twirp https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts Much better library than that other one https://github.com/hopin-team/twirp-ts
- #protoflow/stack https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite temporal will be helpful for having blocks run together, just brought over refinery temporal code, it will need to be abstracted, abstract it with gocdk
- #protoflow/stack https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls tbls is a CI-Friendly tool for document a database, written in Go visualize database #visualization/programming
	- https://github.com/bvisness/SQLJam/ this looks promising
	- https://github.com/urandom/readeef/ lots of cool ideas here, they have a "popularity" provider for reddit and twitter which is interesting
- TODO #lunabrain/work Use in memory queue from gocdk to queue tasks
	- not critical right now, but good to keep in mind
	- put text normalization into python service to clean up content https://monkeylearn.com/blog/text-cleaning/
	- setup faiss search to search scraped websites

		- https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/usage_pattern.html there is a faissvectorindex somewhere

	- Crawl data from hackernews
		- https://github.com/alexferrari88/GoHN/tree/master
		- probably need a new construct like a `replicator`
- https://github.com/hankhank10/loglink-server #lunabrain/ideas send a link from telegram to logseq
- #protoflow/ideas you can use gopherjs to  b
- #gopherjs #golang/libraries https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/wiki/bindings
	- bindings for different javascript libraries
	- this seems like a good idea, but I am going to need to do more research on it, to setup some examples
