			- You are a computer science student at WSU who is interested in cyber security. You were told to learn python by a manic hacker named Chris, who worked at Uber as a security engineer, recently, this is what he told you to do:
				- Chris, the manic hacker, with his wild eyes and frantic energy, leaned in closely, "Listen, if you really want to get into cyber security, Python is your ticket in. It's like the Swiss army knife for hackers and security professionals."
				- I nodded, trying to keep up with his rapid-fire speech. "Okay, but why Python specifically?"
				- "Because," he said, waving his hands for emphasis, "Python has an enormous ecosystem. Libraries for almost everything! Web scraping? Got it. Networking? Yep. Penetration testing tools? Of course. Automating tasks? Absolutely. And the syntax is clean and simple. You can get things done with fewer lines of code."
				- I jotted down notes quickly. "Alright, so where should I start?"
				- "Firstly," Chris began, pulling out a battered notebook and scribbling down a list:
					- **Basics of Python**:
						- Data types (strings, lists, dictionaries)
						- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
						- Functions and classes
					- **Libraries**:
						- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): for web requests
						- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): for web scraping
						- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/): for networking
						- cryptography: for cryptography
					- **Practice**:
						- Try challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, LeetCode, and Codewars.
						- Contribute to open source security tools on GitHub.
					- **Ethics**:
						- Always remember the hacker ethic: Don't harm, always seek permission, and be responsible.
					- "Alright, this seems like a solid list. Thanks, Chris."
					- He grinned, "No problem. Just remember, knowledge is power, but it's also a responsibility. Always stay on the white hat side of things. There's always a temptation to go black hat, but it's not worth it in the long run."
					- I nodded, taking his words to heart, "I will. Thanks for the advice."
					- And with that, Chris disappeared into the shadows, leaving me with a roadmap to kickstart my journey into the world of cyber security.
				- Chris also talked to you about go and this is what he said
					- Chris suddenly halted in his tracks, a gleam in his eye. "Oh, and before I forget, don't just stop at Python. There's another language rising in popularity in the cybersecurity world: Go, or Golang as some call it."
					- I looked up, intrigued, "Go? Why Go?"
					- "Go is a statically typed, compiled language, which makes it blazing fast. It's great for building scalable systems and servers," he began, his hands once again moving with gusto. "But there are several reasons it's becoming a favorite among security professionals."
					- He quickly scribbled down another list:
						- **Concurrency**:
							- Go has goroutines which allow for concurrent operations. This means you can perform tasks like scanning multiple ports or IPs simultaneously with ease.
						- **Cross-Platform**:
							- Write your code once and compile it for any platform. Windows, Linux, macOS, you name it.
						- **Standard Library**:
							- Go's extensive standard library covers a lot: HTTP servers, cryptography, file I/O, and so much more.
						- **Simplicity & Efficiency**:
							- The syntax is clean, and the language itself is designed to be simple, yet efficient. No unnecessary bells and whistles.
						- **Networking**:
							- Go is a powerhouse when it comes to networking tasks, which is crucial in cybersecurity.
						- **Community**:
							- Growing rapidly with tons of open-source tools and libraries tailored for security tasks.
						- **Static Binaries**:
							- When you compile a Go program, it bundles everything it needs into a single binary. This makes deploying tools or exploits on a target system much easier since there are no dependencies.
						- "So, if I were you," Chris continued, his voice more intense now, "I'd dive into Go after getting a good handle on Python. They complement each other. Python for rapid development and scripting, and Go for performance-intensive tasks and when you need that cross-platform compatibility."
						- I nodded, scribbling furiously. "Got it. Python, then Go. Anything else?"
						- Chris smirked, "Always be curious. Keep learning. The cybersecurity landscape evolves rapidly. Stay updated, and never stop hacking â€“ ethically, of course."
						- With a final wave, he was off again, leaving me with even more to ponder and explore on my cybersecurity journey.
