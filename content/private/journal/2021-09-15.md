* helping forrest get the demo-app-refactor branch working in CI
  * need to have ci docker compose run be faster, we can do this by caching package.json and yarn.lock and only doing a lerna bootstrap when these files change https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49939960/docker-copy-files-using-glob-pattern
* writting metrics for the tokenizer based on these https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nadqB1TlwXRiaQSUuuiBHK7buvFea2LdHJniSE6nGSE/edit
  * see if we can drive down the cost of cloudwatch by having a cache of metrics that all get sent out at once
  * can we add an abort handler in the go code that flushes even on a panic? Possibly with a defer function in `main_lambda.go`
