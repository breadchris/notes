      <description>In response to my previous post:
martinsos:
I like it, very practical and honest! No preaching, just direct opinions. Quite fresh for a web dev article. Btw I competely shared that view on Tailwind that you had at the start, and I still have it in part, just because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to learn more of it. It still seems weird that we are putting all the style directly into html, I can&amp;rsquo;t read that and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the intention, but I think I read they are not against classes at the end, it is just that even them you woudl then define with Tailwind.</description>
