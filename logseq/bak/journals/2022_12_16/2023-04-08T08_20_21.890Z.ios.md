- sometimes you can make a postgresql migration that fails because there is a name collision
	- ```sql
	  ALTER TABLE "vulnerability"."vulnerability_cwe" ADD CONSTRAINT "vulnerability_cwe_vulnerability_id_cwe_id_key" UNIQUE ("vulnerability_id", "cwe_id");

	- From JC on the LED whips:
	  [12-06, 5:35 p.m.] JC: Oh I got mine from Fiberflies
	  [12-06, 5:38 p.m.] JC: There are a few brands. 
	  Ants on Melon make a lightwhip where the handle portion is called "RGB critter" then they sell the whip attachment head separately
	  [12-06, 5:38 p.m.] JC: RGB critter may have some settings similar to Kitty's but better quality than the one she got off Amazon
	  [12-06, 5:39 p.m.] JC: Then there's another one called GloFX
	  [12-06, 5:39 p.m.] JC: So check those 3 brands.
	- Ants on Melon
	  GloFX
	  FiberFlies
	  [12-06, 5:40 p.m.] JC: They will have different settings
	  [12-06, 5:46 p.m.] JC: There is also the Amazon one like half priced. Comparing that with Fiberflies:
	- Pros:
	  -$
	  -fibers are resilient and not as prone to breaking 
	  -fibers are more smooth
	  -really bright
	  -160x strands vs Fiberflies 80x
	  -handle has a loop to wrap around wrist
	  -very easy to change color modes with one click
	- Cons:
	  -uses 3x AAA batteries
	  -heavier than Fiberflies
	  -handle does not have soft cover, and is heavier, so if you smack yourself doing fiber wield it can really do damage
