- It is easy to shit on `append` in go. The syntax is ugly, it doesn't feel elegant like using `.map` might. The value in `append`, like many other things in go, comes down to simplicity by consistency. When your brain wants to add something to a slice, you immediately snap to append. Your brain as a go developer works exactly like ever other go developer and the result is almost any code that you read acting the same way when it comes to adding values to a slice. Simplicity in code comes in many forms.

	  package main
	  
	  import (
	      . "github.com/breadchris/share/html"
	  )
	  
	  func Render() *Node {
	      var divs []*Node
	      names := []string {
	          "chris",
	          "adam",
	          "john",
	      }
	      for _, name := range names {
	          divs = append(divs, Div(T(name)))
	      }
	      return Div(
	          Ch(divs),
	      )
	  }
	  ```
