- #protoflow/ideas build a full POC of a website where the server is blocks that are routers, and at the end of execution, the data that is returned, is HTML
	- this would be an implementation of pro flow being a hyper media server, because the resulting HTML could include HTMX attributes, which make the returned component reactive
	- you should get your idea on paper and worry about the details later if you could make an AI chat box in a minute by hooking up an input to a open AI block, and then returning HTML you could possibly make a lot of value for yourself
	- if you were able to save a bunch of resources that relate to some specific topic, and then make a good search for that information, you could load it into a chatgpt prompt. The secret for making this work is being able to index content to fit nicely into some contacts if the information that is returned, is too large to fit into the context, and may be in attempt to compress it is done
	- make a hyper media form that can save protobuf messages. An html component will be created and the backend will exist for the form
	- when hooking up observables to nodes you save the observe the world so when another node depends on the output of another name itâ€™s always using just one observable that was created. edges of the graph are different rxgo observable modifiers
