	- I want to build a chat
		- what is the simplest way to build a chat?
			- Go as the backend
				- In charge of storage of data
					- don't need this for chat to start, persistent storage is a nice to have
					- I want to think about this as a I code
				- Going to connect chatters together
					- People's browsers hit endpoints
					- data gets routed
					- we ain't even thankin about channels, servers, auth
			- JS as the frontend
			- Protobuf as the glue between them
- #golang/libraries Write me a go function that walks the repo of a go application, parses every go file, finds cross references, parses and makes a graph
