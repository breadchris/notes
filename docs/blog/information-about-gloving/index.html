<p>- Details</p>
<p>collapsed:: true</p>
<p>- Stacking is placing one hand on top of the other over and over again in different variations so it gives your hands a look like they’re being “stacked.” Stacking is one of a small number of concepts that has no clear origins in any other dance style. It’s a popular entry level gloving move as it’s easy to learn and build off of while also teaching you hand coordination, rhythm and isolation.</p>
<p>- It’s a basic and it’s not hard to learn. It’s a great and easy way to learn hand coordination and is a small move that you can flawlessly integrate into transitions in your shows.</p>

<p>- Details</p>
<p>- The Figure 8 is the up and down movement of your hands in a Figure 8 motion using the rotation of your wrists. The Figure 8 is an old-school classic. Not many glovers use it anymore, but it’s a great move for teaching wrist flexibility and hand movement.</p>
<p>- It’s a great and simple way to teach your hands to follow one another and wrist motion.</p>

<p>- #### Dials</p>
<p>- Details</p>
<p>- Originally created by a glover named Rockstar, &quot;Dialing&quot; is the stacking and switching of individual fingers over one another, typically done in a symmetrical half-circle motion. The concept is almost always done with two fingers, but can get increasingly complex with implementation of all 10 fingers.</p>
<p>- Dialing increases finger independence and is an incredibly versatile concept that can be used in almost any situation. Increasing your skills with dials opens up the door for so many more combos and ideas in your shows.</p>

<p>- #### Conjuring</p>
<p>- Details</p>
<p>- Popularized in Gloving by famous light artists like [PM] Munch, Conjuring is a style in which the glover utilizes the on/off functions of the light to create the illusion that the light is disappearing, teleporting, or changing in some way. Typically only a few lights are left on at a time and then transferred from finger-to-finger by clicking one light off and the other one on. The effect this gives is one of pure magic, as the glover is able to make lights disappear and reappear in a flash</p>
<p>- Conjuring you gain knowledge of the viewers focal point, and they are also good practice for mode changes. One of the least practiced styles in gloving but one of the techniques that will amaze the casual audience.</p>

<p>- #### Mode Switching</p>
<p>- Details</p>
<p>- Mode switching is the act of changing your mode to a different color and flashing pattern selection in the middle of a show by either clicking the buttons on the lights, or an accelerometer trigger. Mode changing is effective for accenting speed control, like when glovers switch to a blinky set during slow, more technical times, and switching to a much more trail inducing set during faster motions.</p>
<p>- Mode changing keeps your viewer on the edge of their seat. Knowing how the modes on your lights are laid out is crucial for this technique, as you must be able to anticipate what’s coming next. Simple things like changing colors or patterns really introduce a wow factor for your viewers, as it is often unexpected.</p>

<p>- #### The Grid</p>
<p>- Details</p>
<p>- A structured representation of the space in front of you. The Grid takes into account forward and backward, left and right, and up and down motions and sections them off equally into a 3D boxed pattern.</p>
<p>- An absolute necessity for any glover. Knowledge of the Grid helps build spatial awareness and is used for accurate and precise placement of almost any move.</p>
