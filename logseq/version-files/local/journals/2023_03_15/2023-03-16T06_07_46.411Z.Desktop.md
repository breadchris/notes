	- but breadnotes is all about high signal notetaking and feedback
	- the right balance between automation and curation needs to take place to get the most out of breadnotes
	- when you want to refine and hone in on an idea, you can create an "RFC" of your ideas
	- very simply using memo
	- people can leave comments and feedback, and all of that is captured back into your notes via logseq
	- twitter is not conducive to the RFC process
	- to get the most out of an RFC process, you as the creator must select individuals or groups that will see your RFC to get the most out of the review process
	- i think about github gists usually containing high signal comments because the idea being shown is something simple and it is frictionless to share a gist with others
