1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
I guess we're gonna try to record this thought with a regular mic so I guess you

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:20,840
could listen to this as kind of like a podcast all right I guess I guess this is

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:30,720
the official high-pinkies podcast because effectively what I can do if this

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,840
audio is embedded in my site is I can link this to hashtag high-pinkies and I could

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,240
put that out there so isn't hasn't logsec effectively made the perfect

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:58,120
podcasting platform because I could just record my thoughts and I could listen to

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:08,760
them back someone else could listen to them back maybe I have the the GitHub

8
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,960
like the script thing where I can turn speech into text but if I have that set

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:28,400
up then I can I can go back and turn turn my the audio that I'm saying until

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,080
like the perfect yeah the perfect podcasting platform I don't see why this

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:49,640
wouldn't work and actually you know what I can do is I could just record a

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:57,840
video so if I I wonder how well this would work if I just wanted to if I could

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,160
sync my phone with my remarkable then I could just take out a sheet of

14
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:10,440
paper right effectively that's what I'd be doing and writing down my notes and

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,500
that could effectively screencast right because you can set up a VNC

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,740
server on a remarkable you could screencast to your phone like I need to

17
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,040
figure out if you can do video or if it's feasible to do video recording over

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:38,880
VNC I guess you have to be connected the same local network which is fine I

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:47,120
mean you're probably on your home Wi-Fi network or if you're walking around I

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,600
think maybe you could do like a mobile hotspot

21
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:01,920
to connect to and then maybe you're remarkable I guess I need to figure out if you

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:15,960
have your iPhone connected or set up as a hotspot can your phone talk to can it

23
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:33,000
talk to I'm trying a blank yeah right okay right if you have a mobile hotspot

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,440
can your phone connect to another device that is shared on the mobile hotspot I

25
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,000
guess is what I'm saying so like as I'm talking right I can talk I can have my

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,680
words roughly translated into text right at least like the the words that are

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,240
if they're nonsense you can click on that word and it will take you to that point

28
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:08,440
in time in the audio and then I could also write if I wanted to just stream my

29
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,680
notes taking right because I have the remarkable I can take out my remarkable I

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,520
can have it be running a VNC server for that my phone connects to right because

31
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,640
they're on the same local network and they should be able to find each other and

32
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,480
then I just record that as a video and then I also insert that into lock set

33
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:37,120
because it can just reference notes so in the repo there would like for this

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,480
entry there would be the audio there would be the playback text which in lock

35
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,000
set mobile you wouldn't be able to see but you could write a plug-in right on the

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
desktop that

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,560
damn why am I doing a blank plug-in on the desktop that would

38
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,240
run as

39
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:45,280
JS that would hopefully this doesn't sound completely okay here and because this is

40
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,720
for sure this is like I guess that's the whole point of the high think he's

41
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,720
broadcast is that it's literally going to sound ridiculous and that's what

42
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:08,360
makes I think he's special you just record yourself thinking

43
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:22,000
yeah anyway I hope I'm able to listen to this back and I guess no I don't need

44
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,240
to listen to this back because I wanted to try to develop this because

45
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,040
theoretically I think he's with even with massive gaps the text that you read

46
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,480
would be different like you could just zoom around to the parts that interest you

47
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,120
so if I start talking about cooking right I could rattle off like an

48
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,640
ingredient recipe for example like like if I could speak naturally and I could

49
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:57,200
say to make a pie crust right and so or I just like say the words like new

50
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:14,840
recipe pie crust one part flour one part butter then a little bit of salt and if

51
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm still here still just thinking so I would say change and

52
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:50,560
I would say change and then I would change the recipe step so for example I would

53
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:09,280
change the recipe step two what you would call it oh I would change the first

54
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:26,280
recipe step of pie crust to be combined flour salt sugar in bowl which would

55
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,080
then like mark that as the step and then for the second one right I would say on

56
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:41,840
this like podcast thing you like you tag it right so it's like I said the word I'm

57
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
just going to say we're in a word right Harvard I don't know why I'm taking

58
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:52,320
hard but I say Harvard and I pronounced it clearly enough that it added the tag

59
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Harvard you could then create a whole page that is like the Grap Results of a whole

60
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,240
page in Logsack that is like the Grap Results of me saying Harvard right I search

61
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,160
through all these like text documents right because that's what this audio would turn

62
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,560
into right it would turn into a text document and it wouldn't be perfect but it's like good

63
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,800
enough right the conversion be good enough that I could go back through everything that

64
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:47,120
I've said right all my notes on something and recall them so for example let's just like

65
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:56,880
what's the stupid example of this like I say the word balloon right I say the word right

66
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,480
now and then maybe tomorrow right maybe tomorrow I go to a circus for whatever reason and

67
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,600
at the circus they have balloons right so this would be the second entry into my note

68
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:22,280
taking journal is balloons so now like through analysis of the text you can identify words

69
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:30,040
or you put that into essentially your personal search engine which I'm going to see right

70
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,260
so I have my notes up right now and I'm going to try to see if I can find this search engine

71
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:53,560
that I saved because I saw it before but I don't quite know so basically if this thing I can

72
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:13,080
definitely had it like somewhere search it was like index damn like so for example if so

73
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:28,120
there's this tool that I have in mind if it was like really fast it was like really fast

74
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,000
right so if I said like I'm reading hacker news right so I start my day and I just hit

75
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:51,480
record right and I start talking and it's like talking about hacker news then then I would have

76
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,560
this thought right of searching like I could then search for the tags like and maybe it works

77
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:18,800
maybe maybe I can do that so search for say hacker news and it was thinking about search now see if

78
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,760
when I saved that article as browsing the internet and I saved that article if it did text extraction

79
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:33,360
because right this is what I want to do this is the whole point of 50 is I can make it trivial like in

80
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:53,360
like a an API call a single API call I could turn a holy shit this could be huge like I could just

81
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:06,080
fork log sec right could I just fork log sec

82
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't know is it like a hacker news and then search now index goddamn what was it maybe I can go

83
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:35,120
online it's very usually so I can leave my note now oh my god this is so funny my face didn't

84
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,840
cool type sensor that's a note now if I wanted to right I could tag it because it right it took

85
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:50,480
me so long to put this in right because that way I can search things from oh it's not called

86
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,960
hacker news it's called white combinator but I remember it in my head is hacker news right so and I'm

87
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:09,200
going to take this note right now and I'm going to say hashtag we'll say hashtag what's what I want to

88
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:24,560
say oh no I guess this is like I think he's going to link it to the page I think he is

89
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:45,600
whoops I come on I think he's that page cool

90
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:58,160
right so this thing and this is the right and if I had this this fucking the title of the page and I

91
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:09,360
wouldn't have to copy it all this shit down so annoying oh my goodness

92
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:28,080
it's not quite organized the way that I wanted to oh well be like close enough maybe

93
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,920
I think it's working hopefully

94
00:15:45,920 --> 00:16:02,160
so I'm going on this train of thought I guess maybe I'll stop here see what happens
