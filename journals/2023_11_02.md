- #go/book What do I want people to learn about Go?
	- Learning Go will make you a better programmer. You could probably make this same argument for pretty much any language, but I think Go teaches you some pretty powerful ideas.
	- The most central one is simplicity. If you really want to study simplicity in programming, you need not look further than Lisp, but I think the way that Go goes about introducing simplicity in programming is a lot more pragmatic. We live in a world where students are taught OOP through Java and C++. Python is the go to dynamic language to get ideas on paper. Functional programming has not hit main stream consciousness just yet so it is hard to see learning a functional language, outside of choice applications, as anything more than a research project in studying programming languages themselves (which I highly recommend you do).

		- The c family of languages
		- You can always see source.
			- This is an absolutely understated capability of Go and one that you might be unaccustomed to if you are coming from most languages.
			- You always can see what code you included.
			- Your code is going to be around for a while.
		- Errors as values are better than the alternative.
		- Pointers are a necessary evil
		- You can freaking just run programs.
			- Even ones with dependencies
		- There is always guidance to be found
		- Simple
			- You can load more code into your head
