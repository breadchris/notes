- #auth #ory ory guys, have you thought about ways that authorization could be better? as in offering libraries to people who build REST apps and providing them a way of enforcing authorization? idk if that question makes sense, but authorization is a huge security problem and that’s kind of why we wanted lunadefend to exist https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/lunadefend/overview/introduction/  a very fast way to protect sensitive data. we already planned on having oathkeeper be the auth proxy that we needed. if there was a dead simple authorization library for major languages then we could get people using it. I was struggling to use ory in my personal projects, and ended up just copying a bunch of files that I created for lunatrace (which were originally from your front end example). but now that you guys have the easy to use react components, it’s a lot easier. The next thing I code, i know ory is the easiest way to get all of my auth things I need for my service.
