	- read uncommitted lets you read data that another transaction is currently operating on, aka a "dirty read"
	- we might run into problems where two packages are inserting the same maintainer, and the package insert that inserted the maintainer gets rolled back and the other insert is relying on the other insert going through. This seems OK for now since both of the inserts would fail, and when the data is going to get collected to be used, the refetch timeout will eventually time out and the latest information will get used.
- The scan sbom queue worker did not have permission to write messages to the static analysis queue
