- #go/book Error checking
	- Error checking is a really difficult problem. It is kind of like a garbage problem, everyone produces garbage, but no one wants to pick it up. Errors come from code that might behave in an unexpected way due to forces outside of the developers control. Code accept's user input, it will do its best to make sense of it, but there are scenarios where it is not possible for the code to handle the data that it was given (the code does addition but gets "hamburger"). Maybe the file that was expected to be at some location isn't, what then? A naive approach to handling this is ceasing the execution of the program, the equivalent of putting your hands up and saying "fuck this shit, im done here". If your code is simple and only being used by you, this might be OK, but what happens when other people want to use your code? To the caller of the code, the panics will be set off like hidden land mines to them. Being able to recover, or handle errors gracefully is important for writing code other people can use.
