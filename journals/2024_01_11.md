- #lunabrain/work
	- prevent chat from printing twice
	- what needs to be done to get site working?

- #100DaysToOffload what is going to happen on this goddamn stream
	- we are building a chat.
	- "a chat you say! but i have discord!" yes, but it sucks! I want to do cool things with my chat like stream it. To have crazy shit happen in it like sending shaders to people. Changing the css and html of the chat.
	- So what will my chat allow. Literally anything, as long as it passes some security checks.
