	- how can you increase the amount of content that an AI prompt can run on?
		- basic approach
			- take the prompt and minimum output amount, add them together
			- get token count of the content, and split the content based on the length of the content
			- keep adding messages until the limit is passed, split the content, add the new message to the next context
