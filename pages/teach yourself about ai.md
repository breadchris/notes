- We are going to be going through a huge upheaval in our world because of AI, and if you want to riding the wave, you should be learning about it now.
- There are a lot of really good blog posts that talk about AI. I really like this video by [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). The series can be listened to by most curious people, and then the last video in the series is where the hard math comes in. You don't need to watch that part to understand how AI works.
