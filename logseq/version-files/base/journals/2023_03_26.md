- #lunabrain/work Things to look at
	- How does FAISS work?
		- https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
		- it is used by another startup https://github.com/GerevAI/gerev/blob/main/app/indexing/faiss_index.py
		- Some documentation about it https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki
	- How does it feel to play with dalai?
		- https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai
	- Can you go from a go struct to a grpc definition?
		- https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=go%20types%20to%20protobuf#ip=1
	- Can you extract text from a PDF in go?
		- https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu
	- How do I do things in svelte?
		- https://svelte.dev/tutorial/readable-stores
	- #golang/libraries How do I use go cdk's Blob store?
		- https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/
		- The abstraction used here is something that will help significantly with scaling up or down a tool.
	- #golang/libraries #gorm Where do I go when I have questions about gorm?
		- https://gorm.io/docs/
- #notetaking/ideas supertag https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPxYt1RNB7E
	- what was I interested in for this?
- #lunabrain/data Could you crawl stack overflow users accounts to index what they do and what their blog is?
	- https://stackoverflow.com/tags/stack-overflow/topusers
- #golang/libraries https://github.com/tasylab/hn.hsblhsn.me/tree/main a good example of how to write a website and bundle it with go
- #golang/libraries Download hackernews information
	- https://github.com/alexferrari88/GoHN/tree/master
- #lunabrain/ideas if you use GPT to do passes over certain information and extract categories you can then take those categories in snippets of content to train a BERT model, which would be more performance. for example, I tag this note with #LunaBrain/Ideas if I could extract the category of information from this text, then I could use this text to help train what tags should exist
- #security/oss https://www.endorlabs.com/blog/introducing-the-top-10-open-source-software-oss-risks well defined oss risks
- #js/libraries https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite build a chrome extension with react and vite
- #javascript/libraries https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite build a chrome extension with react and vite
	- https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension seems like a better one with tailwindcss

	- and if we are all models, and we don't have the data, we can't complete the sentence in a productive way
	  [1:01 PM]
	  i have thought about this my whole life
	  [1:02 PM]
	  we are comprised of the things we are exposed to, and we project what we understand like a puppet master trying to pull strings on some foreign object on their hand
	- 1
	  [1:03 PM]
	  unbeknownst to most engineers, you can't just pull the strings of a computer and be set for life, you have to also learn how to use our meat sacks to do some type of RPC with other humans
	- 1
	  [1:03 PM]
	  and effective human RPC begins with understanding the interface you are communicating with, and that is language
	  [1:04 PM]
	  language is not pure logic, there is emotion when you speak. emotion is the thing that triggers the relevant data in the receiving brain's storage
	- quiet — Today at 1:04 PM
	  I agree with you
	- breadchris — Today at 1:05 PM
	  you don't have to be a public speaker, but you have to be able to make small talk
	  [1:05 PM]
	  and be kind
	  [1:05 PM]
	  know when you are being an asshole
	- quiet — Today at 1:05 PM
	  lol yes
	- breadchris — Today at 1:07 PM
	  I have realized that my ML model is so valuable at this point that I can live the rest of my life based on sharing my model

	  now, i can't upload my conciousness to huggingface yet
	  [1:08 PM]
	  but i can take observations about my own brain through notes
	  [1:08 PM]
	  and then summarize and categorize it
	  [1:08 PM]
	  so it can be an extension of someone else's conciousness
- #lunabrain/ideas You need to be able to run models locally. I would like to be able to use llama locally on my computer and summarize documents.
- #lunabrain/work When scraping data from a page
	- Raw response
	- HTML
	- Article parse
	- Load with chrome too
- #lunabrain/ideas You can craft the way people communicating
	- By defining the "interface" that people expect you to communicate in, you can put the right questions in front of people and they can answer it
	- How can you train a BERT/GPT model on all of the information from libgen?
		- I want to take every book from libgen, and train a neural net that is incredibly good at classifying non-fiction information
		- it would be hard to parse the table of contents, but maybe this is where GPT can be useful
		- Every ebook is basically just a website anyways
- #blogs https://matthewmcateer.me/
- #application #graphql Take a deeper look at https://dgraph.io/, there are some interesting things there.
	- I think there are a lot of interesting ideas here, but I don't think that you need this to start out a company. Don't get nerd sniped!

- #lunabrain/ideas What is the difference between Faiss and llama_index?
	- I think Faiss might do more poorly than llama_index, but probably faster
