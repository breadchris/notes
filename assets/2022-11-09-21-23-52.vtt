Hello, this is the second episode of High Thinkies.

00:07.360 --> 00:13.200
My thoughts coming at you as they're coming at me.

00:13.200 --> 00:28.640
So Alex and I were talking about cybersecurity-related things and what the hell were we thinking

00:28.640 --> 00:29.640
about?

00:29.640 --> 00:33.320
I forget what it was.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.240
But I said, okay, so I had this idea.

00:37.240 --> 00:45.880
So I just got finished watching this incredible video that I guess I'll leave in the text

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
below.

00:46.880 --> 00:56.800
But this video was talking about the history of VRChat and I did not know just how deep

00:56.800 --> 01:00.480
VRChat went.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.960
It's absolutely incredible.

01:01.960 --> 01:14.440
People have programmed so much and the marketplace is so large.

01:14.440 --> 01:25.240
I wonder if high schools have VR club and our kids are learning how to program and post

01:25.240 --> 01:34.360
a fun VR and play the game in such a elaborate detail, but this video is so worth watching.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.280
It's incredible.

01:36.280 --> 01:43.560
And it had me think of building a VR world for CTF players or other types of hackers.

01:43.560 --> 01:51.600
I don't know what it would look like, but because interacting in a virtual world isn't really

01:51.600 --> 01:52.920
easy for programming.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.800
But I don't know, maybe there's something clever, maybe you can make a matrix universe

01:59.800 --> 02:08.440
and give people excited about it, excited about hacking.

02:08.440 --> 02:19.080
But yeah, anyway, it's high-thinkings for today.
