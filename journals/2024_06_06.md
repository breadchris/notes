- #go/debug I want to be able to run code in a delve session so that I can make more involved queries into the current state of the application so that I can have a better idea of where the program went write.
	- I can use the shared object go hack to get code inserted dynamically, but i need to get the current state of the application.
	- intellij has access to this variable information so it must be possible to do this with a debugger
	- ?i eventually want to be able to write clojure programs to write the code?
