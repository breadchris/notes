- #protoflow/work
	- continue improving integration of rx
		- figure out how to make cold observers
	- it seems like you would want to hook up all rx things during the graph creation process and then provide the configured observables and channels to the running infra
	- zip multiple providers up https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo/blob/master/doc/zipfromiterable.md
	- need to figure out the lifecycle of a project being built and deployed
		- hooking up the rx streams is a step
		- resource disconnected
			- streaming service disconnected
		- cleanup
	- reasoning graphs
		- they come in layers
		- abstraction is inherit
		- how could you build a chatgpt powered chat into protoflow?
	- how are lunabrain and protoflow connected?
		- lunabrain is an AI powered chat that lets you configure workflows using protoflow based on different content
			- need to build out protoflow's API a bit more
	- what is needed to get lunabrain integrated with protoflow?
		- need to have golang integration
	- why do people keep asking how to hook a pdf up to chatgpt?
