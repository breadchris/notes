- [[protoflow/pitch]]
	- protoflow's goal is to scope down code so it can be fun and meaningful to write small things
	- if you write an api integration, you didnt just write it for yourself, it is now something you can publish
	- a "lego" of code
	- too much code is like melted plastic together
	- protobuf helps define the holes for your code lego
	- so it can go together with other things, microservices are this at scale
	- the dawn of serverless is a nightmare if everyone is writing untyped js and returning variable schema'd json
	- web development desperately needs senior engineers to say "enough is enough, lets agree on standarized, and sensible dev practices"
	- there is enough history and wisdom in code for us to start to conceptualize how to build code legos that stand the test of time, no one has stepped up to make that happen
	- kubernetes did it with deployment
	- but you look at frontend development, and that shit IS SO FUCKING CONFUSING
	- frontend development doesnt attract smart people who have been mentored
	- they are much more the self taught, aderall kids
	- with shitty managers and cut throat deadlines
	- you have seen mandatory code, this was the original idea of refinery
	- write it in a box and forget about it
	- the company didn't pan out because we had no idea how to market or sell it
	- im still not sure how to market it, but I at least have collected enough data to know the next time I try to write it, what it should look like and the need is still very much present.
