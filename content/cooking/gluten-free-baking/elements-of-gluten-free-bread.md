It was pretty mind blowing when I realized that all gluten-free recipes are just trying to replicate the unique properties of wheat flour and the gluten that is formed when water is added. In this post I want to outline what wheat flour brings to the table, and then what elements go into a state of the art gluten-free bread recipe to replicate this behavior.

Gluten-Full Bread Properties

Gluten-Free Elements

Flours

Starches

Binders

Gums

Enzymes

While my body requires me to be as gluten-free as possible, I find gluten-free baking as an exciting challenge to push the limits of what we can do as bakers to make something that you can slather jam on or use to complete your favorite sandwich. I personally eat a number of things that I prefer to their gluten-full counterparts, but unfortunately there is a pretty big stigma around gluten-free products just "not being good". I task all the bakers reading this to break down this precognition by baking for your friends and surprise them when they are five cookies deep by telling them what they ate was gluten-free.
