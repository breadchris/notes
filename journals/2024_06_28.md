	- there is a place to eat, beerocracy, coffee, adas, guest kitchens, cabins for established elite, random popups that feel like a side quest or mini game, walkies talkies are social media, kids are here screaming with laughter, if you want to "work" by going to tech talks then you can do that and actually learn something about your subject matter. electric scooters dash around, people camping. the level of effort that went into beerocracy is incredible. everything is exceptionally approachable. people want to see and experience interesting things in ways they have never before. I was able to try soldering for the first time in a long time. the waiting line has a ticket dispenser with a super slow rate.
