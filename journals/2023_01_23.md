- how wasp was designed
	- The way we designed Wasp was "form outside" -> we would imagine how we would like to be able to describe the web app in the simplest way via some declarative language, and then we tried to come up with solutions that looks similar to that.
	- Different approach that I would call "from inside" would be trying to understand what a Web App is in its essence, what are its basic parts / concepts / ... and then trying to build a solution based on that.
	- We also did some of "from inside" analysis (we analyzed  a lot of web frameworks and tried to understand what are the common parts and to find a definition of web app that way). So we did both from inside and outside, but still I would say more effort was on the "outside" approach, because we wanted the result to be focused on DX (developer experience).
	- So we came up with these "mockups" of what writing in this made up language could look like, and then we iterated and iterated on that until we got something that was both satisfying from the DX side but it was also achiavable -> which means we made some trade offs on the way, dropped a thing here or there, only to make it easier to build first version and to get going. Some of those choices included recognizing when a sub-problem is already solved well, and using existing solutions.
	  For example, we recognized that we want to have pages, Operations (Queries and Actions), Entities. That came from the "outside analysis". We started designing our own, but soon realized there are solutions that match them very well. We chose React for pages/components because it is a great match + most popular on the market, react-query because it was perfect match (I didn't know about it when I came up with concept of Actions/queries, so when I found it I was thrilled, since it follows the same design very closely). Similar for Prisma, it just fit so well with Entities that it made much more sense to go with it than to build our system from scratch.
	- When choosing solutions, we used two main criteria: how good of a fit it is to what we imagined + how popular it is / might become.
	- It is true that they influence our direction and possibly limit us in some way, but they also:
	  1. Attract a lot of people who are already using those and who feel good knowing that there is familiar ground when using Wasp.
	  2. Sped us up a lot since we then get to focus on other stuff, the "glue" of web app, which is anyway what we recognize as the biggest problem.
