# Substitiions

* Collection of substitions - http://www.foodsubs.com/

Ingredients can be substitued, but their functional purpose, as they relate to the recipe are very important. Using milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk is generally ok, however if a lot of buttermilk is required, then the resulting flavor might be off.
