- #ctfg design requirements
	- why I am writing this
		- I have gone back and forth about designing a stack that feels both comfortable to develop in, but also one that is capable of
	- simple
		- someone with basic programming skills should be able to make changes that they are cool
		- self explanatory code
			- it should be clear where code
	- customizable
		- i should be able to make cool css and js happen on the pages
			- svelte
				- seems to have solid community
				- mdn has documentation on how to use it
				- a number of components libs seem to exist
				- generated js seems a lot simpler
				- skeptical about typescript support see ((63dc5dfb-36f7-438e-a679-6049fc2d745e))
			- react
				- while this is a powerful framework
			- vue
				- havent used it much, seems similar to how svelte looks/feels.
	- easy to run
		- local dev comes up in one command
			- sqlite or postgre -> gorm
		- simple to deploy
			- single binary, no environmental dependencies
			- single docker file
	- strict types

		- communicate clearly how data is transferred between the client and server
			- graphql
				- have not found a system that works
			- grpc
				- request and response from client should be json
					- twitch twirp can generate json client and server
				- requires types to be managed in proto files
					- Another technology to use
		- writing code that accesses data that might not be there at runtime should fail build
			- generated types are used when using RPC methods

			- Quick breads
				- Pancakes
				- Cookies

				- Yeasted breads are more involved. While they do not necessarily take up more [[cookwherever/terminology/active time]]
