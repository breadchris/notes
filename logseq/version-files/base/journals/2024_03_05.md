	- #go/book/nil even though nil is the cause of some mysterious errors, the problems are usually pretty obvious. it becomes instinctual to debug. I am not saying it is great, but it isnt crippling. You can put off using pointers for some time.

	- web apps that don't break
		- I have told my friend I was working on a web site with, "my least favorite part of building this is the javascript." It kills me to learn how to program with a library or framework only to have it break on me a week later when bumping versions. Over the past few years, I have built a stack of tech that scales from one dev to a team at a large company. More web apps should be built upon the Go community's stable language and libraries, and it starts with sharing research such as this.
