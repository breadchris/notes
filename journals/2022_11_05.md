	  if you can stream of consciousness into a medium that can then become searchable later on if he comes very easy to build out languages that you can speak that locks sake tent can interpret as certain actions and then parson into whatever data format you have specified for example if you wanted to keep track of ideas and share them that were that are related to a group of concepts or keywords so for example if I’m taking this little note now I could tell whatever listening to what I’m saying to Chi off of the word emphasis and when I say emphasis I guess a better example is if I research that makes a lot more sense so if you can make some thing like the script where you have the input a speech and the responses text unlocks that you can record your voice talking as as a audio recording that can be picked up by a plug in that you had to lock sake and or actually maybe no you know what you can do is your program can run on GitHub it’s so it’s actually pretty funny because as I’m talking I’m reading back through what I have already said and shit I forgot my train of thought OK so back on this idea so if you have it will like the script where you can go it’s not the script it’s a descript  OK I got it right that time so if you have a tool like the script which can take what you were saying in translated to text I guess it’s it’s still dropping some words that I’m saying so you need to find some thing that has a good AA model of taking speech with microphone and turning it to text like I think there’s a tool open whisper or I guess maybe that’s like the released model so if you could take an open source voice recorder voice to text you can record your voice as audio on iOS save that to your notes get her burrito ever Hito it’s not a burrito what I am saying is that if you take your voice recorded as audio on your iOS phone than that can get transmitted to get home get hub GITHEBGATHEP space space GATHUB this is a vet this speech to text is not very good or I guess it doesn’t have to be perfect and that’s the point it just needs to be good enough that as you’re listening to it it shows you the space on the video or is it the timeline of the video where the thought was sudden thought was said but yet once it’s on GitHub you can run and get up action that will transform your speech into text and then committed to the repo repo
