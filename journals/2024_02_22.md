- #justshare/chat how to make chat cracked
	- I want to reinforce the social hierarchy of members in a chat by having different levels of a nested Chatree for example, at the very top would be me because I'm setting the vibe and my stream only shows chats of only the highest quality only the truly remarkable comments that are golden members make so we got gold tier that's on me it's like next to me they can talk directly to me so underneath gol is silver tear and these people are pretty cool but their messages like have to get voted on so you have like a different levels of this you get different power structures from like history so you can implement like oligarchy mode where you get like three people have to decide on like whether they're not to ban someone or something like that from the chat or mute them but then you can have full on an once in a while you could just randomly bump user from like bronze to silver tear and when they get to so this is just like chaos like you can call us like moving between the hierarchies, so yeah you just have this like cracked system for Chad and it's hierarchy I don't know if he's so stupid
