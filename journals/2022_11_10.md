	- OSS security solutions are "good enough" for most security problems
	- the problem falls in governence
	- what should a good vuln management dashboard look like?
		- governence
		- dedupe
		- triage
		- compliance
		- supress
		- exceptions

	- ferraday
	- find the rhythm of the business
		- what actions do people expect to be able to perform on vulnerabilities?
	- manage the state machine for vulnerabilities
	- reduce context that someone needs to keep in their mind
	- bsides segment tracking risk
	- source of running results
	- orchestration of scans is not desirable
	- scans are different than reporting
	- coverage metrics
	- is the roll-out of a vulnerability management effort successful?
	- post triage queue
		- sla extensions
	- where do the vulnerabilities come from?
		- pentests
		- bug bounty
	- demonstrate how bug classes are killed
	- breadth vs depth of vulnerability remediation?
		- breadth -> high fidelity, high risk findings
	- oss rollout takes time
	- compliance requirements
		- sla document
		- soc2, how many criticals in a month
		- low sev tasks, compliance requirement time bombs
	- junior sec eng turns on tools, adds a bunch of vulns to backlog that sla document says needs to be resolved, compliance becomes annoying
	- jira and other comms programs _must_ be supported
		- comms have to be intuitive
