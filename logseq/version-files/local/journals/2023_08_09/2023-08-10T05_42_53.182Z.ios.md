	- When you start putting a name to things that you think about, the idea starts to collect momentum. Indexing a series of observations under a central name means you can continuously refer to this idea over time, take it off the shelf, look at it, improve it, and put it back for when you have more to add to it.
	- You don’t need to get the name right on the first time. Let the name come naturally and try on different ones. When you need to commit to a name, you do start to accrue debt in the form of people’s perception of what it is that you are doing and frequent name changes can be disorienting. Be flexible, but also be deliberate.
