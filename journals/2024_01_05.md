	- for github pages, it is [required to have a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the root of the domain that points to `<username>.github.io` google domains does not let you do this, you should use [cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) instead of google's dns

	- no checkout was set to `false`, and that was causing some weird issue where files would not be staged. setting it to `true` fixed this problem
	  
	  before
	  ```go
	  func getGitCloneOptions(gitUrl string, snapshotOptions types.SnapshotOptions, progress io.Writer) *git.CloneOptions {
	  cloneOptions := git.CloneOptions{
	  URL:        gitUrl,
	  Progress:   progress,
	  }
	  // If a branch is specified but no specific commit for checkout is specified, we can go ahead and checkout that branch and only the latest commit
	  // if a commit is specified, we are going to go into a detached HEAD on some unknown branch in a later step, so clone everything for now
	  if snapshotOptions.GitBranch != "" && snapshotOptions.GitCommit == "" {
	  cloneOptions.ReferenceName = plumbing.NewBranchReferenceName(snapshotOptions.GitBranch)
	  cloneOptions.SingleBranch = true
	  cloneOptions.Depth = 1
	  }
	  return &cloneOptions
	  }
