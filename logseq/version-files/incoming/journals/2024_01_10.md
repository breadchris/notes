	- I want to build a chat
		- what is the simplest way to build a chat?
			- Go as the backend
				- In charge of storage of data
					- don't need this for chat to start, persistent storage is a nice to have
					- I want to think about this as a I code
				- Going to connect chatters together
					- People's browsers hit endpoints
					- data gets routed
					- we ain't even thankin about channels, servers, auth
			- JS as the frontend
				- Display the chats

			- Protobuf as the glue between them
				- Connect rpc will gen js client code _and_ go server code
				- ```protobuf
				  service ChatService {
				    // Sends a message to a chat room.
				    rpc SendMessage (SendMessageRequest) returns (SendMessageResponse);
				  
				    // Receives stream of messages for a chat room.
				    rpc ReceiveMessages (ReceiveMessagesRequest) returns (stream Message);
				  ```

	- ​i think project based learning is way more valuable than reading books imo
		- Project based learning is "hands on"
			- which is sick!
		- project = remember through different "senses" or ways of engagement, knowledge requires "materials"
		- books = long cohesive train of thought, it is easy to show a lot of ways of looking at something, what could go wrong "cheaply", knowledge costs as much as the book
		- ya need both, ya dingus!
		- response: ​Honestly? i think its the opposite, i'd say reading is breadth while PBL is depth. For me, PBL allows me to target my focus and learning on the things that are most important to me, while reading
		- response: I think theres also a big difference here as im speaking from a game dev perspective, you might be looking from a different perspective. Also, i didnt mean to discount books! Just that i prefer PBL.
		- ​books are inherently more passive, it is easy to say "I understood that already!" while entirely missing the point. on the other hand they can tell you things you would never figure out on your own
			- there are no consequences!
	- ​i'd like to point out that like how biology is the science of living things maths is the science of patterns. I strongly doubt you don't use any patterns.
