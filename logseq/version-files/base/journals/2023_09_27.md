	- My passion for cyber security was ignited by witnessing older peers excel in hacking competitions during my time at Poolesville High School. Eager to follow in their footsteps, I took part in the Brooklyn Polytechnic CSAW HSF competition and became a finalist, forming connections with brilliant minds from across the nation. This experience laid the foundation for a robust social network, which later proved instrumental in landing security engineering positions at BAE Systems and Uber, where I played a pivotal role in building Uber's mobile security team, saving the company millions of dollars. Our security startup, LunaSec, was put on the map during the Log4j vulnerability incident, where our insightful and accurate blog post gained widespread recognition and earned a coveted spot on the top of Hacker News. Teaching is my passion and I am fully committed to sharing knowledge and empowering others in the realm of cyber security.
