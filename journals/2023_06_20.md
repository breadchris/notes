- #protoflow/work
	- buttons for generating type information and implementation
	- to selectively update a block's type, the proto files are going to need to be parsed
	- need to figure out how blocks are going to be uniquely identified
		- using a name is semi-unreliable since a name needs to be expressed in different ways
	- able to parse proto files and print them
		- should be able to update them in place with the type information
- #ctfg/internship
	- skill levels
		- beginner
			- no ctf experience
			- might have taken CS classes
			- possible challenges
				- copy and paste flag
		- intermediate
			- has played in at least one ctf
			- seeks out educational content outside of ctfs
				- watching videos
				- reading blog posts
			- plays war games
			- looks at previous
		- expert
			- plays ctfs habitually
	- during a competition there are "transitional players" who cross over the skill boundary during the course of the competition
		- skill vs drive
	- how to measure skill level
		- define a skill tree
			- start with ctf challenges and work backwards
			- have taken a computer science class
				- programming knowledge
			- math preq
				- for crypto
		- voluntary response
			- do you have formal computer science education (have you taken a class)
			- have you played in a ctf before
		- skill based assessment
	- research will serve as the foundation for improving the quality of future ctfg competitions
		- how effectively can ctfg teach cyber security
	- action items
		- walk through walkthrough https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen/tree/master/competitions/mcpshsf-2023
			- try to find the challenge that is being talked about in the challenges folder https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen/tree/master/competitions/mcpshsf-2023/chals
			- go from challenge config file to the code that the config is for
				- https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ACTFg%2Fchalgen%20caesar_cipher&type=code
			- https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen/tree/e37f412d9f6e4997d74d722aeb49e8f3d9e97dfd/docs
		- build a hypothesis
			- Completion percentage increases
			- time for completion decreases
			- as competitor is in "flow state"
		- pick one category of challenge, and build out skill tree
		- google form to accurately, and without bias, assess someone's placement in the ctfg skill level categories
		- provide challenges that provide enough mental incentive to continue to be interested in competing in a single competition and then ultimately continually over time. Challenges, as the name implies, should challenging.
		- present adequately challenging challenges for skill level competitor and observe how they interact with the challenge
			- collect metrics
				- time for completion
				- google searches
				- tools
				- completion percentage
			- collect qualitative data
				- reactions during solving
					- frustrated
					- balance of perplexed, but intrigued
				- competitor reflection form of challenge
