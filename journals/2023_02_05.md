	- The **hexagonal architecture**, or **ports and adapters architecture**, is an architectural pattern used in [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design). It aims at creating [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and [adapters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern). This makes components exchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)#cite_note-:0-1)
