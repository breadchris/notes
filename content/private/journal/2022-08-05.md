- working on error in production that says "failed to insert build dependencies"
```
errorÂ {

code

validation-failed

error

field "project_path" not found in type: 'build_dependency_relationship_insert_input'

path

$.selectionSet.insert_build_dependency_relationship.args.objects[0].project_path

}
```

seems like some incorrect metadata?

- fixed go commit problem go [[git]]
	- alex suggestion: only read files from git pack files and do not do a checkout. this would help not modify a repo on disk and avoid any weird checkout problems
