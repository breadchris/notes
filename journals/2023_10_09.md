	- https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown #swift/libraries
		- https://github.com/christianselig/Markdownosaur/tree/main for using with swift markdown
	- wasn't able to get the markdown working easily, going to pause it

	- it would be cool to namespace tags based on domains
		- people can combine different domains together to "merge" content
	- added create, get, and delete groups
	- need to figure out how to handle tags
		- do tags belong to a group?
	- import notes from logseq and search through the tags
