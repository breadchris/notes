	- Explain to me step by step how a Go function is different from a Python function. Include example code in each step that could be clear enough for a high schooler to be able to see the differences. Each example should be themed with references that relate to pokemon. In the explanation, insert lines from Ash as if he is talking to his pokemon and the pokemon are talking back from the Pokemon TV show that say something in character in response to the pokemon related information. They should express their emotions as they might act on an episode of the TV show Pokemon.

	  Convert the following direction: "Add remaining wood chunks to either pile of coals; cover and cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thighs registers about 185 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes longer (internal grill temperature should register about 310 degrees)" into a json object that could be used for inserting a prisma object into the database. Only use fields that are defined in the prisma schema. Go through each type defined in the schema and locate instances of it in the direction. When an instance is found, convert it to the corresponding type in the prisma schema. All fields in the prisma type will be filled out with the located content from the direction. Use the prisma schema below as the schema for the database:
