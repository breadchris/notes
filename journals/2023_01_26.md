- #blog ideas about teachers
	- yeah, great teachers are the key to our future as humans, they always have been
	- it makes me so sad to see them get shit on by "advanced" communities
	- my theory on this relates to social capital actually
	- kids are not seen as a net positive to an intelligent person any more
	- kids detract from the progress that an individual can make
	- pretty much every one of my friends do not want to have kids
	- or at least they say
	- social connectivness, when it was its highest in the US, post WWII, resulted in the baby boomers and with it a plethora of strong local communities that supported their children
	- without the right perception around mental health, kids revolted, and ever since, we have seen pop culture focus a lot more on apathy and violence than it really ever had
	- the world has been painted as terrifying and lonely by too many things, and it is much easier to fixate on what is negative (because we are creatures of survival) than it is the positive
	- as someone who has seen what is beautiful, I don't think there is anything more beautiful than the process of cultivating life, and I want to be an example to the world that it is possible that cultivating new life is just as important (if not more) than trying to "improve" or "progress" our own
	- it is a similar reason I am so obsessed with plants. there is something so incredibly satisfying about taking a seed and turning it into a fresh vegetable you can eat.
