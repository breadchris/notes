- How you can Build and Solve anÂ NCIS-style, Cyber Forensics Murder Mystery
- Some history
	- security is still very new
	- ![catch-me.jpg](../assets/catch-me_1701124297453_0.jpg){:height 390, :width 262}
	- "hacking" has still only recently been accepted
	- ![210139.webp](../assets/210139_1701124113889_0.webp){:height 581, :width 273}
	- and so very few people really get this stuff
	- ![Coding da Vinci Kultur Hackathon.jpg](../assets/Coding_da_Vinci_Kultur_Hackathon_1701124502794_0.jpg)
	- but it is growing
	- ![Defcon Conference Las Vegas.webp](../assets/Defcon_Conference_Las_Vegas_1701124452224_0.webp){:height 347, :width 532}
	- and games are at the center
	- ![Capture the Flag Vis.jpg](../assets/Capture_the_Flag_Vis_1701124540584_0.jpg)
- How do you teach this stuff?
	- inherently hard to teach
	- ![Wargames Movie Poster.jpg](../assets/Wargames_Movie_Poster_1701124230393_0.jpg){:height 565, :width 357}
	- You can teach standards and protocols
	- ![Linux System Administration 1990.jpg](../assets/Linux_System_Administration_1990_1701123862218_0.jpg){:height 444, :width 307}
	- But technology changes rapidly
	- ![Capture-2023-11-27-142243.png](../assets/Capture-2023-11-27-142243_1701123776509_0.png){:height 396, :width 210}
	- And what do you focus on?
	- ![Security Mindmap.png](../assets/Security_Mindmap_1701123966048_0.png){:height 425, :width 562}
	- Historically you get certifications
	- ![Cyber Security Certifications.jpg](../assets/Cyber_Security_Certifications_1701124943115_0.jpg){:height 304, :width 525}
	- Colleges sparsely offer courses, and even less majors
	- TODO
	-
- playing games
	- Games teach in an imperfect way
	- You accept you will not teach everything
	- You aim to teach _how to learn_
- cyber game styles
	- CTF
	- pattern matching
	- not inclusive
	- miss out on many practical skills
	- picoctf -> CMU
	- high school CTFs -> TJ
- what if hacking was just like the movies?

- We did this at NYU
	- ran many for years
	- ![CSAW Brooklyn Polytechnic.jpg](../assets/CSAW_Brooklyn_Polytechnic_1701124718490_0.jpg)
	- high schoolers from around the US would get flown to NYC to hack
	- ![World's Largest Student Security Contest Names Top Cyber Sleuths, Hackers,  and Researchers | NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/cinema_large_default_1x/public/migrated/2015-11/pressrelease/CSAW-2015.jpg?h=7e756c91&itok=PtHSWiDS)
	- student volunteers
	- competitors would become creators
	- helped build cyber security programs at high schools
