	- go htmx react
		- you want go because it will be around for a while
		- code wont break
		- htmx brings UI reasonably closer to go
		- you still want network effect of react
			- and for buildings apps, not just sites
		- htmx and go templates do not have a good story for typing
		- proposal
			- go template a protobuf message as data
			- function applied {{ .Msg | form }}
			- generates a typescript file next to the template that contains code for a component that would be hooked up to that code at runtime
			- typescript types are validated to make sure the types check out
			- compiled js is included in template
			- {{ .List | sortedList }}
				- generates: <SortedList list={list} /> where list is a prop that is passed in
			- maybe use web components?
			- eventually js gets replaced with some other language?
