- ![A Type of Programming Draft Dec 8.pdf](../assets/A_Type_of_Programming_Draft_Dec_8_1702169465977_0.pdf) #programming/functional #haskell
- #xctf/work
	- work on #mcpshsf/2024
	- meet up with luk
- #lunabrain/work
	- it would be nice to put together a demo that could be used to show people something
		- saving text
		- saving a url
			- having this be processed
		- creating a shared space between people
	- I want to be able to start using it too
		- fix browsing extension
			- instead of saving to omnivore, you would save to lunabrain
		- make common scenarios better
			- entering content in as a nested list should feel perfect
				- what about images? other content embedded?
			- mobile app taking notes
				- how does sync work?
	- tags seem to work ok
	- test out #entgo
		- this seems like generally the right decision since you will always be able to move off of it by just building the SQL directly
		- this seems to be a decision that scales pretty far
	- rebrand to #justshare ?
	- what if this was a bittorrent server/client
		- people share encrypted content with each other
		- password must be shared physically to start
			- secret key cryptograph is very strong and simple
			- you intentionally don't want this to scale until you put it on ipfs or something
	- #lunabrain/trust circles of trust
		- I have content that I want to share with other people
		- I want them to leave content for me
		- We want to define who our circle of trust is
		- We want to know who added who, and understand if low signal people are added, who were the people who added them
		- The further you move from the root of trust, the less trust there is
		- Having a simple, but robust authorization system is imperative
	- #lunabrain/publish publishing ideas #lunabrain/share
		- There are different ways that I want to publish ideas
			- Knowledge dump
				- what garden.breadchris.com is today
				- low effort
				- should be completely automatic
				- authorization/visibility controls should be available to configure who can see what parts of my knowledge dump
					- I don't care about people seeing what articles I read
					- I care if I write sensitive information
				- AI can be used to safe guard potentially missed authorization controls
			- Tweets
				- When I have some short thought that has some purpose put into it
				- I want to control what groups see it
					- tags can help control this
				- lower signal, high volume
			- Blog post
				- A thought out and deliberate article that I want people to see when they go to breadchris.com
				- This is high signal, low volume content that I want people to see
			- Feed
				- A feed of all content I generate
				- You get this for free with GRPC
				- Rate limits can be used for pricing
		- Customization is important, but not critical
			- When building a personal brand, content generation is important
			- Customization is important to distinguish yourself from others in a notable way
				- A well designed/fun website goes a long way
				- many people think fondly of all the services where this is the case
			- Themes are a nice middle ground of customizability
			- Hugo is a solid foundation for a content generation platform
			- SEO is important
- #protoflow/work
	- need a demo to show people
	- `protoflow init` -> scaffolds new project
	- `protoflow studio` -> starts the studio service
		- build a service
		- build a method
			- support streams
		- build a proto message?
			- could start by having a text input that parses the proto
		- invoke a method
		- AI
			- generated go code that gets set as method handler
			- generate proto message
			- mock out a function executing with just a prompt
				- structured output comes from protobuf types
		- react component builder?
			- based on the type information, add a call to the service, and then some display of the data
	- protoflow needs to be a module that you can put into an app so it isnt a separate process
		- the studio should be able to come up effortlessly
		- embedded into an application
	- style with tailwindcss+daisyui
- #breadchrisos
	- an operating system that is loaded into a browser
	-
