[{"content":"You can think about a lot of different things all the time. Think about too many things and this becomes a serious problem, especially for those who have ADD. If you have a problem focusing on which idea to pursue, it is easy to experience the feeling of being lost. Life is happening, ideas come and go, but there is nothing for you to bring to show and tell.\nI am not an expert in this field of study, but I do pay attention to what constitutes a ‚Äúgreat thinker‚Äù. Or maybe a better term for the people I am thinking about is ‚Äúsustainable thinker‚Äù.\nPatience A sustainable thinker is one who has, above everything else, patience. An idea will come and go, and it will not phase them. Instead, they take note of it. Often times a physical note, in a place that they frequently take their notes. There is organization to the way they take in information. Over time, these observations grow and connections are formed between new observations and older observations. Higher level concepts are synthesized. It becomes effortless to understand an entire domain of information. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. To them this actually might be the beginning of what they consider ‚Äúhaving an idea‚Äù. They take their hypothesis wherever they go. To the best of their ability, they will try to find data to suggest what they believe isn‚Äôt true.\nReading A sustainable thinker reads. Often times long form text like books or insightful blogs. There is a purpose to how and what they read. But a very important point here is that these people are not machines that solely exist to consume well thought out content day in/day out. No, these are still humans who enjoy memes and bingeing mindless TV. See, a patient thinker understands the bigger picture. They are human on a planet of humans. Not everyone is like them, and so everyone has something to share. Being able to interact with actual humans through colloquial phrases and honest emotional communication is vital. Honoring the give and take of time and energy that comes with existing is paramount to a sustainable thinker.\nAlign with Sustainable Thinkers I try to align myself with the patient thinkers I am fortunate enough to interact with. I find it an immense privilege to be able to ask questions of these people. It makes me feel rewarded to be able to provide well researched insight of my own to my peers.\nI probably still have too many threads of thought I pull at every day, but I think I am on to something. I kind of have this master plan for what I am working on, but I also realize it will take time. I need to be patient and continue to be present and honest with myself. Through this practice, I have felt immensely rewarded even for doing the smallest of things, like writing a single note for a given day.\nRegardless if you are or strive to be a sustainable thinker, I wish you all the best on your journey through your own mind üôè\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/pages/a-sustainable-thinker-always-wins/","summary":"You can think about a lot of different things all the time.

I got involved in cyber security because the older kids competed in a competition that was for hacking and they did very well. So I strived to be like them and compete in competitions. Note that around this time CTFs were gaining traction, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t quite got to the high schoolers yet. So the competition that I got brought up on was Brooklyn Polytechnic (now¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Tandon_School_of_Engineering) CSAW HSF (High School Forensics). It was a month long competition for high schoolers where the first round you had to spend a month looking at NCIS-like cyber forensics data online (go to fake website clones of facebook to look at someone\u0026rsquo;s profile, they link to an image they took, image has EXIF data in it that has the next bit of evidence). So this competition was so cool that me and my friends were finalists for the competition. It was so cool, not only did you get an all expenses paid for trip to New york city to compete in finals, you got to also interact with all the other ridiculously smart finalists. They were from all over the country and they were all so cool that we ended up connecting our online social networks with them. A number of my friends today were finalists from that competition, including my roommate. They don\u0026rsquo;t run this competition anymore because of politics, but I am trying to keep it alive with¬†https://github.com/CTFg/CTFg.\nThis jump started my social network so my friends and I were now networked with the best cyber security people in the US going into college. The college I went to had a cyber security lab (OSIRIS LAB, you have to play a CTF to get admission into the lab, it is pretty cool). It was a place to hang out between classes and work on cyber security stuff (like CTFs, hacking hardware, talking about semantics of programming) like some serious nerds here lol. There were leadership opportunities which meant that I could learn how to be better at organizing people to work on tasks together (which was something i enjoyed). One of those leadership opportunities was running the very same competition that I got into college with, HSF. I was able to take all of the things I learned while playing the competition, and implement them in a competition that every kid in America would get a chance to play with, how cool was that. The mentors that I had helping me put this together were top notch, some of the best roll models to follow in the footsteps of (they are all amazing people who live great lives).\nI leveraged this lab\u0026rsquo;s network to get me my internships. I worked at BAE systems for two years doing static code analysis to look for 0day vulnerabilities in a product they were using. I then got to intern at Uber which completely changed my life, once again.\nWorking at Uber let me see what choosing the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; things really, really fast looked like. They were operating at such massive scale when I joined. The project I got hired onto only had a manager. Literally an intern and a manager. And together we built out the entire mobile security team. Our code is still run on every phone that has Uber downloaded and it is responsible for saving Uber the 20% of revenue that they lost to fraud. Millions and millions of dollars.\nUnderstanding my impact to the world let me feel confident enough to join @Free Wortley (a coworker of mine from Uber) to work on Refinery. He derisked my decision to jump ship of a well paying job (without a college degree since I dropped out), to get paid way less, but on an opportunity that could change my life. We didn\u0026rsquo;t use our security skills for the first product we were working on, so we changed to developing LunaDefend. This is a project was a work of love. It took the biggest problems that we saw at the other silicon valley companies in regards to security and solved it with this security framework. Unfortunately selling a dev tool is only something that you can do when you have hit a homerun of a product idea, and we just didnt quite get there. \u0026hellip;and then came the big one.\nAs I was walking out the door to go work from the day at free\u0026rsquo;s, @alex told me about a chinese blog that was talking about a vulnerability in a widely used java library. I thought that was interesting, and drove off. Later that day Free and I were talking about what we could write about that might help us solve our SEO problem. What really cool blog post could we write about that would wow HN. I told Free about what alex had told me and we thought about it for a while. How many projects use Log4j? How hard is it to exploit this vulnerability? What could you do if you exploited this? \u0026hellip; wait minecraft kids are using this to crash servers with a chat box message? Could this really be as bad as we think it is? Are we living through the worst vulnerability that has ever happened to the internet?\nTurns out, yes, we absolutely were experiencing this thing for real. While this wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually a zero day (there was a version out with a fix) the communication of the vulnerability was lagging so hard that the chinese blog poster actually was looking at the github commit made to patch the vulnerability and writing about it on his own personal blog. This is what alex translated and read to me that morning. We poured over every single ounce of information that we could get our hands on. Pulling up the log4j code. Making a POC of the exploit. Our blog post had links to tweets that others had made.\nOur blog post gets popular on HN, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the first result on the page. At the top was another blog post that someone had submitted. Looking at it, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really that clear as to what you were supposed to do to fix the issue. Our blog post had everything someone responding from it would have dreamt of. It was clear, concise and most importantly accurate. This quality of work earned us the opportunity of an HN mod replacing the top link of HN to ours.\nMost importantly, we kept the blog up to date as more information became available to us through our vast social network that we now became in tune with. Asking the right questions and making the advice from the community as clear and actionable as possible.\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/pages/how-i-got-to-where-i-am/","summary":"So i was in a really good high school¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolesville_High_School¬†and so there would be some ridiculously smart people who would work on things and because the program was so close knit, information would disseminate between the grades and so the younger group of kids would only get that much better.

The Figure 8 is an old-school classic. Not many glovers use it anymore, but it‚Äôs a great move for teaching wrist flexibility and hand movement.\nIt‚Äôs a great and simple way to teach your hands to follow one another and wrist motion.\nImages\nVideos\nWho Uses It\nTrippz\nBoo\nMimik\nVariations\nLiquid Figure 8\nLiquid 8\nSplit 8\nLiquid Details\nLiquid is the following of one hand with another along a line so that your hand and body seem to move like flowing water.

Often considered a necessity in a performance, these moves are fast moving circles that are whipped out into your audiences point of view, leaving a spectacular trail that extends from yourself, to their melting face.\nWhips \u0026amp; Tunnels are some of the foundations of light shows themselves. To really master the craft of gloving, you¬†*need¬†*these in your set of moves to really show off your speed and skill.\nImages\nVideos\nWho Uses It\nStunna\nMimik\nPanda\nDials Details\nOriginally created by a glover named Rockstar, \u0026ldquo;Dialing\u0026rdquo; is the stacking and switching of individual fingers over one another, typically done in a symmetrical half-circle motion. The concept is almost always done with two fingers, but can get increasingly complex with implementation of all 10 fingers.\nDialing increases finger independence and is an incredibly versatile concept that can be used in almost any situation.

Typically only a few lights are left on at a time and then transferred from finger-to-finger by clicking one light off and the other one on. The effect this gives is one of pure magic, as the glover is able to make lights disappear and reappear in a flash\nConjuring you gain knowledge of the viewers focal point, and they are also good practice for mode changes. One of the least practiced styles in gloving but one of the techniques that will amaze the casual audience.\nImages\nVideos\nWho Uses It\nMunch\nWarrior\nMez\nMode Switching Details\nMode switching¬†is the act of changing your mode¬†to a different color and flashing pattern selection in the middle of a show by either clicking the buttons on the lights, or an accelerometer trigger. Mode changing is effective for accenting speed control, like when glovers switch to a blinky set during slow, more technical times, and switching to a much more trail inducing set during faster motions.\nMode changing keeps your viewer on the edge of their seat. Knowing how the modes on your lights are laid out is crucial for this technique, as you must be able to anticipate what‚Äôs coming next. Simple things like changing colors or patterns really introduce a wow factor for your viewers, as it is often unexpected.\nWho Uses It\nFlow\nMateria\nIce Kream Teddy\nThe Grid Details\nA structured representation of the space in front of you. The Grid takes into account forward and backward, left and right, and up and down motions and sections them off equally into a 3D boxed pattern.\nAn absolute necessity for any glover.

The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU. It feels disrespectful¬†to all of the volunteers (you and I included) that worked so hard to not just maintain the quality of the program, but to make it 1% better every year, and make sure everything was in place for it to keep running.\nThe issue has stemmed from the push of making CSAW an international competition. The student¬†volunteers were burdened with trying to handle this rapid¬†expansion on the fly and the quality of the competition suffered. There was no longer anything \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; about CSAW since you can\u0026rsquo;t have physical challenges when everything needs to be run in 10 different places. High school students and teachers all experienced this massive drop in quality and care for the competition. CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop. NYU dropped their golden egg.\nThis was one of the reasons I decided to drop out of NYU. I was being offered a fantastic job at Uber, while having to fight to try to keep the security lab that special place that made it what it was. We weren\u0026rsquo;t able to have a two time HSF finalist get accepted into NYU. Most finalists don\u0026rsquo;t even consider going to NYU as they usually have their sights set on CMU, MIT, etc. A friend of mine, a three time finalist, only decided to go because he would be¬†paid¬†to go to NYU. Another friend would also have been paid, but decided to go elsewhere.\nThere is no competition on the planet that embraces the spirit of HSF (as it was). CTFs encourage a fire and forget mentality, once you have learned the patterns you need to learn. In fighting to preserve the HSF format, I was¬†repeatedly told that HSF would not scale, and that was the reason why it became a CTF for highschoolers.\nI wrote this challenge generator, partially out of frustration, to prove that it was possible to scale a competition that encourages cohesive problem solving skills. And even more importantly, it teaches students how to communicate the work that they have done and rewards them for spending that time. The ex-HSF finalists that I still stay in communication with, who remember how HSF was, are frothing at the mouth at the idea of this competition coming back.\nMy dream with rebooting HSF is to preserve the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; that you feel when you spend a week perusing the evidence, only to look at something for the 10th time and see what you were missing. Or being at finals and being given a phone and a \u0026ldquo;good luck\u0026rdquo;. You were the one who showed me how special this competition was. We had facetime, as highschoolers, with real government agents doing this for a living.\nI want to have a package that I can give to a community college that has a teacher that cares about cyber security, and show them how to run this for themselves. If we want to improve the cyber security talent pipeline, we have to fight to find those sleeping creative thinkers and give them a sanctuary¬†to practice the dark arts of cyber security. NYU did not fight for this sanctuary, and the program suffered.\nThe reason I am so passionate about this competition is that it literally has made me who I am. When I applied to colleges, I applied to 13 colleges¬†and only got into UMD and NYU. UMD gave me no scholarship money (even though I gave a presentation to the senior class of UMD\u0026rsquo;s Cyber Aces program, sponsored by Northrup Grumman, on what it was like to intern there since I had interned at NG for two years). NYU didn\u0026rsquo;t just give me money for being a finalist, but I talked to Joy (the year before she was let go) and she cared enough to make it remotely financially feasible for me to go there. CSAW brought the best high school/collegiate cyber security talent into the same room, for multiple days, every year. The roommates that I live with are HSF finalists. Because of CSAW, a national network of introverts has been solidified and is bringing the future of cyber security, and I reap the benefits of it.\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/pages/nyu-dropped-the-ball/","summary":"How it went wrong I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time.

Let‚Äôs make that easier.\nStart with Markdown and hugo. Markdown is trivial to learn and making a website is instant. Hugo is a single binary you download, run and boom there is your website. A number of themes are available for you to check out and play with, but they aren‚Äôt necessary to start out.\nIf you want to have more control over how things are formatted and roughly look, html will be the next step of learning. By itself, it will be relatively limited, but you can get pretty far with including a simple CSS style sheet like this one.\nIf you want to move things around on the page, make them bigger/smaller, red/blue. You are going to need to learn CSS. As you learn more about CSS, you should consider playing with css libraries like bootstrap or tailwindcss which will greatly scale up your abilities as you try to do more complicated and coordinated visual things.\nWhen you want things on the page to move around things, you are going to want to learn Javascript. There is a lot that you can do with javascript. Understanding that a webpage is a tree of nested objects with names and identifiers will be important to spend time on. The internet will try to convince you that you need to know React, Angular, Vue, but you just don‚Äôt need it right now. These are javascript frameworks that really let you do some crazy things, but stay simple as long as you can. Once you find yourself needing to model a bunch of data on a page, I would recommending learning the javascript framework Svelte. Of all the frameworks, it is, in my opinion, the closest framework to the knowledge you already know about html, css, javascript.\nIf you have learned about html, css, and javascript, you are probably already building some cool things. You can still run the same hugo command and generate your website and not needing to think about much. But maybe you want to store data so it doesn‚Äôt go away when you refresh the page. If this is the case, you are going to want to build a backend. A backend is complimentary to your frontend as it runs as its own process and listens for requests your frontend sends to it. If you took my advice and learned Svelte, they have a super easy way to build a backend called SvelteKit. If you went with React, there is the great option of NextJS. If you haven‚Äôt learned either of these, you will probably want to learn about express and how to build REST api endpoints.\nIf you are feeling pretty good about all of this, then you are well on your way for some serious application development. These are the things that every application developer does every day at their company and you have your own foothold into this whole market. You are super valuable as a result. Look at all the things you know! You must have spent a ton of time looking at the internet for help on building these things and someone will pay for that.

Whether they are rigid semantic properties that will cause your code to fail to compile, or ideas around how to name variables, people replicate what they see in code.\nAI has shown us just how deeply rooted these lines of thinking are. The more patterns that emerge in code, the easier it is for an AI to replicate these patterns. The \u0026ldquo;clever\u0026rdquo; developer comes up with hack after hack and more often than not writes code which they are only capable of comprehending. Since these are \u0026ldquo;clever\u0026rdquo; solutions which demonstrate a deep understanding of the tool being used, an AI might have a harder time arriving at the same solution.\nBut with Legos, it is quite difficult to bend the rules.¬†Insert meme of stepping on lego. I mean, they are physically quite hard and not designed to bend. As a result, those who play with Legos are much more capable of seeing, reverse engineering, and repeating patterns they see when building sets or looking at other\u0026rsquo;s builds. There are no secrets, there are rarely any surprises, just consistent creative thinking.\nLegos as Code It makes sense why we don\u0026rsquo;t have coding Legos, it is really hard to build. We are constantly pushing the boundary of what computers are capable of doing every day. AWS, GCP, Azure, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it but AlibabaCloud, these are all¬†massive¬†collections of code that are at the point where you have to play Jeopardy with them to figure out how to do the simplest of things\n\u0026ldquo;Chris, it is your board\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I will take \u0026lsquo;4 nines\u0026rsquo; for 100, please\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;This service with a multi-character acronym made of a single letter is capable of holding a blob up to 5 TB in size and distributing it around the world.\u0026rdquo;\nWith a Lego, you can always physically touch and see what a block is capable of doing. Short of showing up to a datacenter, I am not sure how I can physically interact with my data or code. I have to rely one documentation of features, trial and error to see what works or doesn\u0026rsquo;t. It seems far too often I have to become an expert in an entire cloud technology before I actually reap the amazing benefits of it. All the while, I am probably burning cash in order to understand how the system works\u0026hellip;\nI teach high schoolers to code using¬†Scrach. Scratch is a block based programming language where the blocks snap into each other. It is about as close to coding Legos as we can get, and my students love it. They come up with the most incredible programs, even those who would rather be still in bed at 8am in the morning. And where else do we see block based programming? Oh right, some of the largest video games in the world Minecraft and Roblox.\nThe thing is, we have written enough applications to know exactly¬†what is needed¬†to take most ideas and scale them up to be legitimate businesses. Hell, Roblox is making¬†bank¬†off of children¬†building programs¬†in their ecosystem.\nWhere are my Legos? So what I am wondering is \u0026ldquo;Where are my Legos?\u0026rdquo;.\nYou might be different than me, but it would be so cool if I could do the following and for it to \u0026ldquo;just work\u0026rdquo;:\nOpen up my web browser and go to a coding site.\nWrite a single function that does something that I have done a thousand times (idk, some webscraper or something).\nIf my function depends on some other function, file storage, database, library, be able to easily connect that to my code in a way that I can use it (types, please for the love of god, I need types)\nSend the function some data.\nCall the function with some input data, verify my assumptions.\nClick \u0026ldquo;deploy\u0026rdquo; and have the function be something that I can call remotely.\nConfigure the function to run on a schedule, when an event happens, etc.\nIf I like my code and I want to make it accessible for other people to start using, I want to formally define how to interact with my service by¬†defining a contract.\nAll of this, by the way, could be made incredibly efficient to run too. With the dawn of¬†firecracker¬†serverless workflows can be spun up incredibly fast.\nClosing Remarks We are in an age where so many problems that can be solved by code. CRUD apps that scale to thousands of users are trivial to write. The problem is the talent pipeline. Lessons being taught at bootcamps are not teaching sustainable programming. They aren\u0026rsquo;t teaching people how to \u0026ldquo;code Legos\u0026rdquo;. Companies that dictate bootcamp curriculum have tech stacks that are heavily dependent on code that has been written many years ago. Something as simple as writing untyped code spells disaster for any hope of writing code that could eventually be composable.\nAnyways, I literally think about this every day and talk about it with friends in¬†my discord¬†so if you are interested in learning more, please come and hang!\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/pages/we-need-legos-for-code/","summary":"Playing with Legos Legos are fun, they are¬†composable. Code is not composable, not at least in the way we learn to code\nDifferent environments come with different constraints which end up with different code. Different ecosystems have different standards and ways to solve a problem.\nLegos have been designed to have an incredibly rigid specification that has been upheld for many years. It is trivial to determine impostor bricks (I am looking at you Mega Blocks) from an actual Lego.","title":"We need Legos for Code"},{"content":"I don‚Äôt know if I personally would say that my life has been ‚Äúhard‚Äù. I hear people use this to describe their life; ‚ÄúI have fallen on hard times‚Äù. But I don‚Äôt know, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a relatable feeling. I have had to solve ‚Äúhard‚Äù problems. Whether it is a math problem with seemingly random symbols or trying to comprehend why my parents won‚Äôt get along with each other.\nI think I would say my life has been ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù and I try my best to work every day to make it less challenging in certain ways so I can make room for challenges that I actually want. If something happens with a friend where we aren‚Äôt communicating well, I try my best to resolve this problem. I do this because I know I won‚Äôt be able to focus on writing the code I want. I want to be challenged by code, I don‚Äôt want to be challenged by emotions.\nFortunately for me, it seems that I have a pretty good idea about how to tackle emotions. I like to think that I have been blessed by an innate ability to see and understand patterns, as well as having environments in my life that have made me feel safe and secure. In high school I was in an incredible school program for nerds, in college I was a part of a student run cyber security lab, I dropped out of school to work at Uber with Phds and other drop outs who all had incredible passion for the work they did. Ever since high school, I have been a part of at least one group who made me feel seen for who I was.\nWhen I talk at length with my friends and peers about how they are doing, I grow more and more surprised? shocked? with every conversation. It is obviously purely qualitative, but goddamn, it seems like everyone experiences some degree of depression? Even my friends who permanently have a smile on their face, same thing, some type of perpetual sadness.\nI want to be very careful when addressing this because:\nI don‚Äôt want to seem oblivious, yes I see how much pain there is in the world Insensitive to people‚Äôs very real feelings of depression Make those reading this to feel like I am saying ‚Äúhaha you have depression and I don‚Äôt‚Äù. I am very sensitive to other‚Äôs feelings around me, and it makes me sad that others so close to me experience this. The thing is I just simply don‚Äôt experience what people describe when they describe depression. It is sometimes hard to get out of bed in the morning, but it has never seemed ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù as people have described. Days haven‚Äôt passed where it feels like I have done ‚Äúnothing important‚Äù. Reflecting on my life, I realize I have unintentionally been trying to solve these feelings for others my whole life. Most namely my parent‚Äôs. Playing counselor for their shouting matches has left me with two things: an intuitive ability to speak non-confrontationally, but also a deep complex I have around trying to solve other‚Äôs problems.\nThese things have significantly affected my life and being able to address feelings in a productive way has been something you can‚Äôt even begin to put a price on. This deep vulnerability however, has been something I have struggled with, most notably in regards to close friendships and romantic ones. I have fought really hard with myself to over come this, but at the end of the day the true force that got me out of these situations is simply one thing; my support system.\nMy friends, family, co-workers, even regular people I would see at boxing or the skate park. These are the people who showed me what love and respect should look like. Just before I went through a really tough breakup I was able to visit with a number of friends and what hit me, I‚Äôm talking a real ‚Äúhitting me like a brick‚Äù scenario, was that how I feel around my good friends is how I should always be feeling. I feel safe and secure around these people, I can be myself, who made me feel seen. Well then why would I ever be around someone who wasn‚Äôt making me feel that way? The math just didn‚Äôt add up.\nThere is an amazing book that I try to get people to read. It is incredibly terse so I understand if you don‚Äôt want to read it. Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam looks at how social life in the US has changed over time. The TL;DR is that groups and physical spaces where people would congregate are significantly declining as people find their social connections becoming more digital. Sitting in front of the radio listening to cowboy westerns, became watching them on TV, and now you watch a new western every month on your phone. This may seem like an obvious point, but an important one. Digital relationships are different. You can‚Äôt get hugged from across the Internet in a way that someone from a support group could do if you break down crying. Deeply human activities like exercising are limited. It becomes a lot easier to bully a faceless victim with words, which in turn forces victims into safe spaces which almost inevitably become echo chambers of emotion. I said ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù for a reason. Digital relationships are not inherently bad. I have built many relationships from various chat rooms (granted I have always made it a point to meet with them physically, eventually). The most compelling argument for how a digital presence is actually incredibly positive can be found in this documentary about VR chat.\nThis pain I discover in so many people is what is holding us back. No, I am not trying be profound here, I am just stating a fact. How can we be collectively working towards ‚Äúthe perfect thing‚Äù, whatever that may be, when there is so much unaccounted pain day to day? Universally embracing mental health has become so painfully obvious to me as what we should be investing in understanding, and yet the research in the field of psychology is underwhelming. My girlfriend, who studied psychology, explained to me that there was this research who proved that the results of most psychology studies up until some point were not satisfactory. This single study essentially reversed decades of work. The study of psychedelics has been something that has interested me greatly. The ability to visualize these things that hold us back sounds so incredibly powerful to me and they are actually effective at curing depression! I‚Äôll save my thoughts on this for another post, I think I should probably end this one ü§£\nThere is only one thing I want you to walking away from this post thinking about. I want you to think about the ways that you feel seen and what you do to make others feel seen. This might seem incredibly confusing, but just think about it next time you are in a group of friends. What does someone do that makes you feel good? Do they smile at you? Remember something important about you? Do you like the inside jokes you have with each other? Perhaps you realize you actually don‚Äôt feel seen by your friends. Maybe a friend says something that makes your chest tighten. Perhaps you realize you can‚Äôt share something important about yourself with everyone because people would laugh. I really believe if we want to start healing from the ‚Äúthings that hold us back‚Äù we have to be conscious about these things about ourselves. Good luck out there! Life is freaking hard man ü§£\n","permalink":"https://breadchris.com/pages/what-holds-us-back/","summary":"I don‚Äôt know if I personally would say that my life has been ‚Äúhard‚Äù.
