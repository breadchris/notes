- #go/book chi router is super confusing
	- There are many ways to register routes, and the "helper" functions are more confusing than they are helpful. I want a router that makes it very straightforward on how routes are layed out. I want middleware to be easily applied. It should be very visually clear how routes and sub-routes are related to each other. This is not the case in chi, and most other router libraries as far as I am aware. The sub-routing feels like an after thought, but is critical for organizing a larger project. The side effect is that every developer who runs into complexity, will have to think through a design on how to represent these routes. The result is inconsistent code across projects. Not necessarily bad, but it certainly inhibits the velocity of a developer when they want to carry over their skills. Go added http route parameters to their standard library which improves the status quo of how people think about adding routes, but the sub-routes is still a problem.
