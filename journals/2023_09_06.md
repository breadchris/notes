	- -
	- [1:40 PM]
	- oh i think you need 4) savings to live your ideal life for like 6 months

	- sharing all of the weird thoughts and feelings that comprise you with another person, and being accepted by them, means that you aren't ever second guessing your existence
	- -
	- [1:46 PM]
	- i have a lot of friends who don't want to have kids, but having a partner who also wants to have kids is critical. i want to have biological computers I can program to out live me

	- all of this to say, your success at building and running a company is entirely, possibly exclusively, dependent on how much you have your own life together
	- -
	- [1:47 PM]
	- yes, you should try to grind on building a company, but also develop a sense when you are being strung too thin and focus on your own life/health. my cofounder had to take a few months off to realign his life
	- -
	- [1:48 PM]
	- and now we are going to go down to SF to, probably, raise another couple mil with our current idea
	- -
	- [1:48 PM]
	- running a startup is closer to the skills you need to run a marathon vs sprinting
