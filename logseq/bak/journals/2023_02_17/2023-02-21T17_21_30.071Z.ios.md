	- Ok, let’s say your software has a single vulnerability. Let’s forget about CVSS scores, why software it is in, all of that stuff. Actually, let’s forget about vulnerabilities all together, let’s talk about boats. If your boat had a hole in it, you would patch that hole as fast as you could. You wouldn’t want your boat to take on water and sink right?
	- For a boat that is supposed to be out at sea for months, a hole in your boat spells disaster, but what if your boat didn’t need to sail for months? What if you had a row boat you took out occasionally to do some fishing? And that hole is actually pretty small, the only really notice it when you bring your boat to shore and see a bit of water. When are you going to fix that hole? Right then and there? Tomorrow? A week from now? A month?
	- While you would still technically call that hole in your rowboat a “breach”
