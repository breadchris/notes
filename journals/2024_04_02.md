- #go/book #go/design The Proposal Process
	- Underneath the syntax and runtime is a very important system that is often overlooked when it comes to a language. Usually there is "the person" who built the language, and successful languages often come from the person wanting a language to suit their needs, not finding one, and then making their own. Over time, more people want to use the language and balancing constraints of what is included or not included in a language starts to become challenging. Go has very strong principles around the vision of the language which have largely contributed to its adoption. A consistent message that starts with the [proposal process](https://github.com/golang/proposal/). Anyone is welcome to contribute their thoughts, as long as they abide by what the process dictates. The community weighs in and as it gets more traction it continues on, if it doesn't it will be rejected.
