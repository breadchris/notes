- #lunabrain/work
	- trying to build a POC extension that records when you go from hackernews to another page
		- recording this relationship will help you sort through things that you find interesting
		- also get this working for ios?
		- categorize articles that you click on with AI?
			- #gpt/prompts You are a hierarchical classifier for a software engineer who reads hackernews. You accept content and then only return a list of categorical paths where that content would exist. The path should be in the form: category/subcategory/other-category
	- chrome history search is written
	- I want to get to adding tags to history, omnivore style
	- i want to build a short form content viewing UI
		- something like tinder/youtube shorts/tiktok
	- Take important sentences from text using #js/libraries https://winkjs.org/examples.html winkjs and suggest tags?
		- https://observablehq.com/@winkjs/how-to-visualize-key-sentences-in-a-document
	- get page contents via extension https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/blob/main/pkg/extension/src/scripts/content/prepare-content.js#L274 and store it to lunabrain
	- If page contents can't be scraped via extension, then try using shiori https://github.com/go-shiori/go-readability #golang/libraries
	- #chrome/extension https://github.com/tgrassl/rekishi/ chrome browsing history viewer
		- pretty neat, wasn't able to get running, i like the ideas
