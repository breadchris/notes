      <title>The Go Proposal Process</title>

      <description>Underneath the syntax and runtime is a very important system that is often overlooked in a language. Usually, there is &amp;ldquo;the person&amp;rdquo; who built the language, and successful languages often come from the person wanting a language to suit their needs, not finding one, and then making their own. Over time, more people want to use the language, and balancing constraints of what is included or not included in a language becomes challenging.</description>

      <title>notes about coroutines?</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/notes-about-coroutines/</link>

      <description>Even though the &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; keyword is the same name as the language, you would think this is more commonly used. From my experience, go developers, including myself, will avoid using go routines and channels as much as possible. The reason is that it adds complexity that you often don&amp;rsquo;t need. Concurrent code unlocks a lot of performance as tasks that would otherwise &amp;ldquo;stop the world&amp;rdquo; only stop the go routine that they are on.</description>

      <description>I feel like being put on a hospital bed and prodded every time I am in an interview. A rigid agenda of a strange conversation where the person on the other end is trying to profile you. It is an extraordinary interaction that I really hope improves over time. I usually get greeted by a nice interviewer, or someone trying to play nice at least, for the roles I am applying to.</description>

      <description>As the flickering lights of monitors illuminate the shadowed visage of a hacker, known in the cyber realms as Zero Cool, the mind behind the screen drifts away from the usual code and into the realm of daily organization. Amid the clutter of local Apple Notes, a thought emerges, tinged with the desire for something more open, more connected. “What if,” muses Zero Cool, “my notes could seamlessly sync with the very fabric of my digital life?</description>

      <description>The debate between statically and dynamically typed languages has always been a hot topic in software development. Designing types for a problem can feel like solving a puzzle—fun for some and frustrating for others. But the real question is: Do you know how to represent the domain? While the alpha engineer may claim they do, understanding a domain comes from observing patterns over time.
The challenge in business, where code is most commonly used, is collecting and understanding the data needed to define these types accurately.</description>

      <description>In the realm of software development, the dichotomy between local development environments and production settings presents a notable challenge. The ideal scenario is where both environments mirror each other as closely as possible, minimizing discrepancies that can lead to unexpected behaviors upon deployment. However, achieving this level of synchronization is fraught with complexities. Tools like Docker have emerged as potential solutions, offering the promise of containerization to encapsulate applications in self-contained units that can run consistently across various environments.</description>

      <title>go dependency injection</title>

      <description>Dependency injection has radically increased my programming rate. When everything is designed as a module, you find yourself constantly reusing things you have already written since it is the path of least resistance.
If you try to do this without the help of a framework, you will find yourself writing and rewriting the boilerplate code to connect dependencies together. Most DI frameworks resolve dependency graphs at runtime https://github.com/uber-go/fx
A dependency graph resolved at runtime is error prone and leads to confusing code.</description>

      <description>In response to my previous post:
martinsos:
I like it, very practical and honest! No preaching, just direct opinions. Quite fresh for a web dev article. Btw I competely shared that view on Tailwind that you had at the start, and I still have it in part, just because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to learn more of it. It still seems weird that we are putting all the style directly into html, I can&amp;rsquo;t read that and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the intention, but I think I read they are not against classes at the end, it is just that even them you woudl then define with Tailwind.</description>

      <description>I get that it took a while for IRCv3 to come out, but the more I think about my ideal form of communication, the more it looks like IRC. I mostly communicate with Simple text comms, with the occasional voice/video chat. I also want to be able to write bots to receive and send messages on channels. Moderation controls are important for larger channels.
There is a Go server/client implementation, ergo, that I am excited to try out.</description>

      <title>anatomy of syntax</title>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/anatomy-of-syntax/</guid>
      <description>Something I do not see often in programming language books is a concise explanation of semantic structures that are typically used. For example, in a Java method, there are different modifiers you can apply to the function to change how it behaves (public, private, static, etc.) Usually, the syntax is introduced and it is talked about at length, covering the many edge cases that might exist or the syntax is introduced in passing as an example requires a reader&amp;rsquo;s comprehension of the topic, referencing a later section for the explaination.</description>

      <description>When coding, have you ever stopped to ask the question: why am I doing this? Maybe it is a fleeting thought before you return to squeezing out a few more milliseconds on your page load.
As creators of software and websites, we often get caught up in the never-ending pursuit of optimization. We constantly strive to make our code more efficient, our algorithms faster, and our page load times shorter. But in our relentless quest for optimization, we may lose sight of the bigger picture.</description>

Designing Data Driven Applications by Martin Kleppmann - amazon
Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers.</description>

      <description>Testing in software development often finds itself at the tail end of the feature development cycle, sometimes viewed as a necessary evil to uphold code coverage metrics rather than an integral part of the development process. However, the significance of testing cannot be overstated—the safety net ensures our towering stack of dependencies doesn&amp;rsquo;t collapse at the slightest touch.
A quick Google search on &amp;ldquo; testing&amp;rdquo; unveils a fascinating landscape of testing frameworks across various programming languages.</description>

      <description>Their lovemaking was passionate, if quiet; she felt every atom of her body, his body, heavy in their node of space/time, replete with potential. Calvin breathed harshly beneath her, and she threw her hips into it with vigorous intensity, pressuring and sliding away from the place where their bodies were joined in abandon and rapidity. His eyes fluttered closed and he had to muffle a hoarse shout, and she felt him coming inside of her; when his thumb slid up to caress her clitoris, with a touch both gentle and firm, she came, too; and then again, as he returned the touch almost as soon as the first wave of convulsions had left her.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, staring at something long enough is all it takes to figure out what to improve.
I moved from the TipTap editor to BlockNote, built on TipTap, but it comes with all the features I would expect in an editor setup. I especially like what they did with the concept of blocks, which has expanded my mind about what an editor can contain. On the desktop, the editor works pretty well; there is enough space to support the information the editor will include, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look quite right on mobile.</description>

      <description>So, I have been told that I need to read Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and there is a reason for this. What is that reason? It depends on the importance of knowledge and information to the survival of society, and it&amp;rsquo;s very pertinent today, even though it was written before the Internet was invented.
When was the editor so? I think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up; I need to re-implement it, but I could do/ask if it&amp;rsquo;s there.</description>

Character Crafter
Absolutely, I&amp;rsquo;d love to help you brainstorm a character! Let&amp;rsquo;s start by considering a few key elements:
Archetype: Do you have a specific archetype in mind, such as The Hero, The Rebel, The Sage, or maybe The Innocent? Each archetype brings its own set of traits and narrative possibilities.
Role in Story: Is this character your protagonist, antagonist, a sidekick, or perhaps a mentor figure?</description>

There are several factors that have contributed to companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all originating from the same region in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Some of the reasons include:
1. Skilled labor pool: The PNW has a strong history of highly skilled workers in fields such as manufacturing, technology, and logistics.</description>

      <description>Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing.</description>

      <description>From the first moment I saw it, I thought that gRPC was going to change how people transferred data on the Internet. What are we using? Untyped JSON to REST endpoint? Obviously asking for problems. JSON schema? Better, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write that crap. Also tooling is annoying. GraphQL? Pretty nice. Better than gRPC when dealing with many related objects, but again tooling is eh. gRPC is built on Protobuf, a simple type system that has been battle-hardened by Google and other large companies over the past 20 years.</description>

      <description>Well I have gone down the rabbit hole today on changing the way that everything looks. There are still some blemishes, but there is much more space for writing content. Oh, and I also added an AI feature where if you highlight the text then it will ask you if you want to use that as a prompt and the output will be streamed into the editor. I am super stoked with the progress that I have made here.</description>

      <description>I had some interviews today. In the first one, I was asked a question to which I knew the answer, but the words weren&amp;rsquo;t quite there. I felt myself looping on, thinking of the answer, and then being frustrated. Time passed, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my thoughts into words. Somewhere deep in my knowledge I knew how to respond, but in the moment I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer. Overall, the interviews went fine.</description>

      <description>I had a friend take me on a journey through elm today while on stream today. The exercises they gave me were really well thought out and it was a lot of fun to feel how the code evolved between each task. Starting from a simple counter, it built up to where you were managing a list of list of counters. The cycle of building the thing that just works, and then refactoring it so it could take on more abstraction illustrated why elm&amp;rsquo;s architecture shines.</description>

      <description>A common theme in high thinkies is that I want to record my thoughts in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in my way of my thoughts. For example, writing down notes has been historically difficult and when the thinkies are coming in at blistering speed, it is difficult to keep up. So I started to just talk and record what I said. Audio files are super small. I also started streaming to also document what I was working on.</description>

      <description>If you ask anyone who knows me what my thoughts are on javascript, you will get a unanimous &amp;ldquo;he hates it&amp;rdquo;. Typescript helps, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the problems I have with it are actually solvable without some radical changes in the ecosystem. Why do I care so much? Because I freaking want to build websites that stick around for a while goddamnit! Sites built with the &amp;ldquo;right decisions&amp;rdquo; today feel like they fall over from a strong breeze.</description>

      <title>SF Feels like another Planet</title>

      <description>I am visiting SF right now, and almost every billboard in the city has &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; on it. I need to build image upload so that I can show you what I am talking about. I get it, there is a lot of hype for companies to cash in on, so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?
AI (ML or machine learning for the pedantic) is super cool and can do a lot of things now.</description>
