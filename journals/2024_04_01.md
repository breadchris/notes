- #go/book naming
	- The recommendation from the authors is to use short variable names. This felt awkward initially, I wanted to be verbose in describing the purpose of a variable. If you look at standard library code, everything uses short variable names. I think what changed for me over time was that I realized that short variables 1) require less reading, meaning you can read code faster 2) variables being less descriptive are OK as long as functions aren't longer than a screen size. If you can glance at a function, you can see the start and end of a variable's life time, meaning contextual information is more readily available. The function's name and doc become more helpful in providing context clues.
- #jobs/coverletter
	- At Uber, I drove the reduction of driver fraud by developing a mobile security signaling system to detect malicious activity. This novel system collected system signals that were related to attempts to modify the application and the data it relied on. Anti-debugging and reversing measures disincentivized attacker's ability to inspect and modify the code. Once deployed, fraud was driven from a significant, to negligible loss.
	- Critical coverage of the Log4j vulnerability drove millions of visitors to the blog post I authored https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/. A high performance scanner and patcher was developed and used by a number of Fortune 500 companies for mitigating the vulnerability.
