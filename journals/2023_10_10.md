	- I want to display tags in the side bar and be able to filter through them
	- I want to deploy updates to lunabrain and let people join groups
		- need to have group invite
	- I am building something that helps me stay in sync with people whose opinions are valuable to me
		- If I am able to connect more directly to my immediate environment, I can make it better because I can understand how things are connected more effectively
	- tags are displayed properly
	- share to group button that doesn't do anything
		- votes also don't do anything
	- group page doesn't do anything
	- how to get groups in v0 state
		- group invite
