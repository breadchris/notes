	- Title: 101 Ways a Dependency Can Ruin Your Day
	- Elevator Pitch: Right now, you are hacked. Don't believe me? Then prove me wrong. Every day your developers are unknowingly authorizing external developers to have access to your internal infrastructure. This is happening through dependencies. Let's have a look at how you are hacked.
	- Description: Business requirements are built around the use of dependencies. Features are planned and shipped based on external developers working on projects in their free time. Over the years, developers have felt the pain of what happens when this fragile supply chain falls apart; usually by the hands of a single developer. All eyes are on this problem, but attempts to solve this problem are falling short when it comes to preventing these problems (looking at you SBOM). In this talk, we will be taking a trip down memory lane to remind ourselves how we got here in the first place. Digging into the technical details of notable dependency related events, we will illustrate the painfully mundane problems (ie. version hell) to the incredibly targeted attacks (ex. event-stream). Of course, we are not just here to fear monger. Our work has shown us ways that we can survive this ever growing threat, and steps everyone can take to protect themselves.
	- Notes: A year ago we wrote [a blog post](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) about a vulnerability that went viral because it was providing clear, concise recommendations in an otherwise confusing time. The vulnerability being written about, of course, was log4shell. After countless phone calls from people with questions like: "Should I update from 2.15 to 2.16?" and "How can I tell if my fork lift is vulnerable?", it was clear that people need some real help. Over this past year, we have been diving deep into how we, a world built on code, have ended up with this problem. Having done our homework, we are confident we know how to build code that is more secure. This presentation is a snapshot into our learnings and something, we believe, should be talked about.
	- Take aways:
		- For the developers, we hope they will become driven to be proactive in thinking about dependencies the next time they sit down to code. They will have a mental rubric they can use to inquire about the code they are about to use. This is to help stop the bleeding.
		- For applying the bandage, we hope security managers/CISOs will be inspired to critically look at the tools they are using for supply chain security and ask the question of "Am I more secure by using this, or am I more compliant?"

	- when you want to prove out your idea, you want it to be frictionless. Or at least, as frictionless as possible. The reason a good coder costs so much is that they have seen so much shit that doesn’t go together and have persevered to make it go together. The best coders have made things fit together so many times that they make a framework to not have to keep making things go together themselves, the code makes it happen. There is an article about why plumbers make so much, and it’s essentially the same reason ((6383b755-7aec-40f6-9639-322c19dfa59f)).
	- When you don’t think about what pipe fittings to use, you get to focus on the fun stuff. I am not a plumber so I don’t know what the fun stuff of plumbing is, but i’m sure there is something. For coding, the fun stuff is being able to represent data in a new way that you haven’t seen before. See relationships between data for the first time, mp3 files that are now text that you can search. In the age of information, the frictionless development to production experience is nirvana.
