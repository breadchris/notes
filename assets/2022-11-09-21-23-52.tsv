0	7360	Hello, this is the second episode of High Thinkies.
7360	13200	My thoughts coming at you as they're coming at me.
13200	28640	So Alex and I were talking about cybersecurity-related things and what the hell were we thinking
28640	29640	about?
29640	33320	I forget what it was.
33320	37240	But I said, okay, so I had this idea.
37240	45880	So I just got finished watching this incredible video that I guess I'll leave in the text
45880	46880	below.
46880	56800	But this video was talking about the history of VRChat and I did not know just how deep
56800	60480	VRChat went.
60480	61960	It's absolutely incredible.
61960	74440	People have programmed so much and the marketplace is so large.
74440	85240	I wonder if high schools have VR club and our kids are learning how to program and post
85240	94360	a fun VR and play the game in such a elaborate detail, but this video is so worth watching.
94360	96280	It's incredible.
96280	103560	And it had me think of building a VR world for CTF players or other types of hackers.
103560	111600	I don't know what it would look like, but because interacting in a virtual world isn't really
111600	112920	easy for programming.
112920	119800	But I don't know, maybe there's something clever, maybe you can make a matrix universe
119800	128440	and give people excited about it, excited about hacking.
128440	139080	But yeah, anyway, it's high-thinkings for today.
