	- I want the chrome extension to be able to pull up my recent history and have that selectable
	- i need to setup ci/cd so that i can push and not have to worry about having it built correctly
		- maybe just build to different folders "build" and "dist"
	- I want to remove the config dir in the root of the repo
	- I want to hold content in my inventory like minecraft, or hand like a card game, so that I can quickly reference it
		- Also kind of like having a number on speed dial
		- Content that is kept in hand has an automatic time
			- if it hasn't been used in some time, it gets dropped
	- getting the related content to show up is going to be more challenging
