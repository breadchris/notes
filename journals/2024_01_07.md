	- Met someone at a cafe today who does mobile app distribution. Wasn't familiar with the title, but it made sense when he explained it. He is running the numbers behind the in-app mobile advertisements or social media posts advertising a mobile game. There was a lot of new information that I learned about this area of work, including some tools like [SensorTower](https://sensortower.com/).
	- We got into the work that I was doing and it was refreshing to get his perspective. Taking a look at the data around the performance of productivity tools on the app market made it clear that to be a top grossing app in this space, you basically need AI in the title. So many of the apps were just clones of the ChatGPT app, pretty wild.
	- He brought up [Opal](https://www.opal.so/) as an example of a good app. The data that it is showing you is already on your phone, it is just making the metrics more accessible and actually blocks the apps from being opened. The monetization is straight forward; premium features which go beyond the free ones, such as reoccurring focus times for blocking certain apps.
	- The biggest take away that I had was that building something that does some type of metrics around browsing history could be a good app idea. Everyone is always generating this data, and there are a lot of interesting insights that you could make and show someone. Let's ask ChatGPT for some ideas:
		- **Time Spent on Productive Websites:** Tracking the time spent on websites that are directly related to work or productive activities. This might include work-related research, professional development sites, educational platforms, or tools relevant to the person's job.
		- **Frequency of Visits to Productive Websites:** How often productive websites are visited can indicate regular work habits or dedication to learning and professional development.
		- **Time Spent on Non-Productive Websites:** Identifying and measuring the time spent on websites that are typically considered distractions, such as social media, entertainment, or shopping sites
		- **Category Analysis:** Classifying websites into categories (work, social media, news, entertainment, etc.) and analyzing the time spent in each category. This can provide a broader understanding of how a person allocates their online time.
		- **Session Length:** Observing the length of time spent in a single browsing session without breaks can give insights into focus and concentration levels.
		- **Active Hours:** Determining the hours of the day when productive browsing is most frequent. This can help in understanding a person's peak productivity hours.
		- **Frequency of Breaks:** Looking at how often and when breaks are taken. Regular short breaks can actually boost productivity, while frequent long breaks might indicate procrastination.
		- **Sequence of Website Visits:** Analyzing the order in which websites are visited to see if there's a pattern that suggests a workflow or frequent distractions.
		- **Changes Over Time:** Comparing these metrics over different time periods to observe any changes in habits, which can indicate shifts in workload, motivation, or distractions.
		- **Goal Alignment:** Evaluating if the browsing history aligns with stated productivity goals or job requirements.
	- We connected and I am looking forward to running ideas by him in the future!

	- got parsing markdown from notes working
	- need to sync this up with interface
		- use the content URL to know where the content came from
		- how do you identify the latest content from the logseq source?
			- there are different sources of information
				- the database
				- logseq notes
				- twitter
				- youtube
				- etc.
	- make a logseq source where you can view synced notes from a directory
