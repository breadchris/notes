- some thoughts on life
  collapsed:: true
	- #life It feels like it is a privilege to live transparently. If I was sharing all of my thoughts, as I had them, online for the world to see constantly, would that eventually haunt me? If someone wanted to prove that I had a history of doing X, and then they go through my journal to pin me as an evil person, would past me have sealed my future self's fate? It seems like if we want to get closer to each other, we have to be able to freely share our thoughts and feelings without them incriminating us. Having a thought or feeling that is seen by many as objectively wrong should be a warning sign that that person should probably receive more attention and support. I did not really live in a community where it was ok to be racist, sexist, homophobic, so it is sometimes hard to understand how people can hold such beliefs so intimately, so it can be hard to understand how people like that exist. Why does anyone care if a guy wants to fuck another guy? You don't have to watch, I don't think the gay guys really want you to watch either. Where does the fear originate from? Who was the first person to say, "hey, no more of this stuff, that is unnatural". Maybe the first people saw this lifestyle as a threat to humans having kids? Maybe a powerful dude was jealous he couldn't get with some other guy he was in to? It makes me sad to think of all the people in history who never had a chance to truly feel like themselves because of one reason or another. They were too scared to share their thoughts and feelings because the social rejection that they might face. A law might be preventing them from being themselves, their family's acceptance being on the line. Fear and being beaten into submission is however, something that should probably exist in moderation. If we didn't have something to guide us in a direction and keep us on track, most of us would probably be jerking off and smoking weed everyday. I have to some extent beaten myself into submission to be writing my notes everyday. Sitting down and learning to embrace my note taking ritual instead of forgetting to document meaningful work and ideas that I am working on. Habits make us better. You can only start a habit and continue it when you have seen the cost benefit analysis. If you aren't the one who is motivated enough to start the habit, someone else who sees its value is going to, hopefully, be there to make sure you do it. I learned how to use VIM keybindings because of my coworker Corey sitting down with me everyday, unplugging my mouse and forcing me to code with only my keyboard. The "classical" method of teaching by restriction is something that I personally find great, in moderation.

- #lunasec package rewrite
	- if a package.json has install hooks, then rewrite them
	- for the blog post, do analysis of how install hooks are used.
- interesting case to consider for the static analysis  `export default class VcodeInput extends React.Component`
	- what if you have  `this.vulnerableFunction`
	- `vulnerableFunction`  being a part of  `React.Component`
	- ```yaml
