- #lunabrain/work when executing code there's a chance that the code is going to stream data instead of just taking a single input and producing a single output. In the case that the data is being streamed the response should have a channel that can be read by the next block. The executor needs to know how to clean up all surfaces that are streaming output. This can be achieved by using a channel which is selected by the worker and when content is written to the channel the worker closes
- #protoflow/work Adding streaming to blocks
	- Streaming will enable the discord bot message example to work. This will enable long running code to work. This will need to be bullet proofed over time, but it greatly simplifies the value pitch of using protoflow and hooking things up to have them "just work"
	- buf's grpc invoking code is a lot more robust than what is currently being used (streaming works a whole lot better) going to try to switch to using that
- #life/observations/coding Code that is well written is code that you can copy and paste easily. Not to say that this is something that you should be doing all the time, but it is very powerful to be able to copy and paste code and have it _just work_. It is an incredible feat to have large amounts of code be written environment independent enough to be able to copy and paste it somewhere else.
