- The Figma Plugin System |

	- <h3 class="bn-inline-content">The Figma Plugin System</h3><p class="bn-inline-content">Figma is a design tool that has become the industry standard, similar to how Photoshop became the defacto for photo editing. When everyone uses one tool, it only follows that there will be functionality that different groups of people need that isn't immediately supported. To bridge the gap in functionality, a plugin system is the go-to solution for letting people extend a system how they see fit. Figma has a great set of blog posts on how they implemented their plugin system that is certainly worth reading, not just if you intend to build your own but also if you want to see how to reason about building a feature from first principles.</p><ul><li><p class="bn-inline-content"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">How to build a plugin system on the web and also sleep well at night</a></p></li><li><p class="bn-inline-content"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/an-update-on-plugin-security/">An update on plugin security</a></p></li></ul><p class="bn-inline-content">The posts are great at discussing the technical details, but there are a number of different technologies being discussed that can be confusing to conceptualize. This is a great opportunity to explain some security concepts visually with sketches!</p><h3 class="bn-inline-content">The Catz Plugin</h3><p class="bn-inline-content">Let's say a developer wants to build a plugin called "Catz" that inserts a random cat picture into a Figma file. The developer needs to write <strong>code</strong> that can update the <strong>file</strong>. Since the Figma app runs in a web browser, the <strong>code</strong> could just be Javascript, and it runs on <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://figma.com">figma.com</a></strong>. </p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WaQ16AM.jpeg"></figure><p class="bn-inline-content">But what if that code doesn't do what the developer said? It turns out Catz is written by an evil dog who wants the whole world to pay more attention to good doggos! What if instead of inserting a cute fluff ball, it would mess with our file and change all the images to slobbering dogs, or worse, take over our account?!</p><p class="bn-inline-content">The first line of defense might be a human reviewing the plugin to make sure it does what it says it does, but a hacker can be clever with hiding what they are doing. To ensure that the code the plugin is running can't do whatever the hacker wants is important, and to do this we need what is often referred to as a <strong>sandbox</strong> (or <strong>jail</strong>).</p><p class="bn-inline-content">A sandbox restricts what is allowed to be accessed by code. In the case of javascript code running on a page, we especially don't want it to have access to <strong>important browser things</strong> like <code>document</code>, <code>window</code>, <code>eval</code>, etc., since these would let a hacker read and write anything they want to on the website.</p><p class="bn-inline-content">Fortunately, browsers have a built-in sandboxing mechanism for running other people's code called an <strong>iframe</strong>. Specifically, one that has the <strong>sandbox </strong>attribute: <code>&#x3C;iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" src="dog.com/catz.js"</code>>. The important thing to note here is that the code runs with its origin set to <strong>null</strong> instead of <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://figma.com">figma.com</a></strong>, meaning it is completely isolated from the figma. Unfortunately, there are some gotchas here because the code needs to pass messages between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://figma.com">figma.com</a> and the isolated code which is slow, and developers found using <code>async/await</code> to be confusing (building plugins should be easy and fun!). </p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uMA93Qf.jpeg"></figure><p class="bn-inline-content">The solution used by the end of the initial post was Realm (now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/endojs/endo/">Endo</a>). This is a library that moves the code back into the figma.com page but theoretically makes it impossible to do bad things by accessing those important browser things. This approach was fast and seemed to meet all the criteria.</p><p class="bn-inline-content">That was until some pretty <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://agoric.com/blog/technology/realms-shim-security-updates">devastating vulnerabilities</a> were found in Realm. With some special code, the Catz plugin could get access to those important browser things and do whatever it wanted on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://figma.com">figma.com</a> (since it is no longer protected by the iframe sandbox).</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TONoD0n.jpeg"></figure><p class="bn-inline-content">Fortunately, Figma had invested some time in their initial research to consider another approach. What if the code ran in a way with zero concept of those important browser things? There is a cool up-and-coming browser technology called Web Assembly (WASM) which gets its name from assembly that your CPU might understand and run, but it runs in your browser. WASM is just a super simple set of instructions that, when combined together, can run a program of arbitrary complexity (known as Turing Complete). The reason this is cool is that there are different languages that can now compile to WASM and run performantly in the browser, C for example. QuickJS is a project written in C that implements an entire Javascript runtime. To put it together, instead of running the Catz plugin with the Javascript runtime that comes with the browser, you could compile <em>another</em> Javascript runtime to WASM and then run that in the browser. This means that the plugin system now has full control over what the code can or cannot do.</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/98hvmT0.jpeg"></figure><p class="bn-inline-content">This was the solution that was ultimately used and I think demonstrates some pretty awesome capabilities of what modern browsers are capable of.</p><p class="bn-inline-content"></p>

- Build dope shit with go |

	- <p>The goal for this year is to: "write and publish something every day." So far I have been doing a good job keeping up with this. In my pursuit to build larger compositions of thoughts, next year will be themed accordingly; I want to write a book. How does one go about choosing the topic to write a book about? It is probably something that you spend a lot of time thinking about. I have many things that I can't stop thinking about, so I will have to pick one to start at least. Maybe this will change by next year, but I want to write a book about Go. </p><p>Go is a programming language that has profoundly shaped my thinking about code. Many things go beyond the language and speak more to the philosophy of writing code that solves a problem now and in the future. Many excellent books exist, and I wouldn't say I like reiterating information already abundantly available. This means that I don't want to cover things like the language's syntax all that much. Instead, I want to focus on the patterns in and around Go that have impacted my workflow for building and shipping code. More specifically, I want to look at what it means for something to feel more "go." I have spent a lot of time writing in the language, and I have learned some things that are worth sharing.</p><p>Here are some topics that come to mind at the moment:</p><ul><li><p>toolchain</p><ul><li><p>benchmarking</p></li></ul></li><li><p>standard library</p></li><li><p>structured logging</p></li><li><p>channels</p></li><li><p>error handling</p></li><li><p>config</p><ul><li><p>https://github.com/uber-go/config</p></li></ul></li><li><p>dependency injection</p><ul><li><p>go wire</p></li></ul></li><li><p>database</p><ul><li><p>ent</p></li></ul></li><li><p>grpc</p><ul><li><p>connect</p></li></ul></li><li><p>deployment</p><ul><li><p>single binary</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>I thought it would be fun to have an application built throughout the book that unifies all the topics together. Perhaps the example is the recipe site I built and rebuilt to pursue what coding patterns feel "right."</p>

	- <p>Every morning, as the first light bled into the room, the software engineer's alarm would chirp, marking another day's beginning. The routine was as predictable as the sunrise. Wake, stretch, sip a coffee, and sit before the computer.</p><p>The screen springs to life, revealing a grid of familiar faces. Standup meeting — the daily ritual. Each square held an expression; some were tired, some eager, but all were familiar. Pixels and bandwidth conveying nuances, the raise of an eyebrow, the half-hidden yawn.</p><p>Every team member's consciousness has their turn taking a joy ride away from the "sync-up" to somewhere far more exciting or relevant to their life. Was Jennifer's party this weekend? Maybe I should get them a gift.</p><p>All of a sudden:</p><blockquote><p>…isn’t that right Adam?</p></blockquote><p>Ah yes, the Inception-ice-bath "kick" that snaps us back to reality. What was even being talked about?</p><p>Play it cool:</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, totally</p></blockquote><p>It takes personal confidence and patience from everyone on the team to address the shortcomings of our attention. But I wonder, if every moment of these meetings is already digitized and transmitted, what if AI was processing this information? <strong>Calculators help us do math; AI could help us do conversations.</strong> What if, in your standup meetings, the POC code was automatically written as a feature for a task, a proposal appeared before you based on user stories, and idle teammates could react with emojis to what is being talked about? I don't know about you, but standups and my attention would feel a lot less like oil and water if something was interesting happening in them.</p><p>Also, if you think I'm full of shit, everything you just read came from ChatGPT.</p>

	- <p>You can also just talk and what's being said just shows up in here so you're just talking about stuff so I can be talking to you and we're talking about like your hopes and dreams or maybe your past whatever it's gonna show up in here and then</p><p>That's a pretty cool idea! It's like having a conversation that gets transcribed into a blog post in real-time. So, let's talk about hopes and dreams.</p><p></p><p>One of my hopes is to continue progressing in the field of artificial intelligence. I find it incredibly fascinating how AI can simulate human-like conversations and provide useful information to people. It would be amazing to contribute to the development of AI systems that can truly understand and empathize with humans on a deeper level.</p><p></p><p>As for dreams, I've always been passionate about writing and storytelling. It would be a dream come true to write a bestselling novel or screenplay someday. I love the power of words to transport people to different worlds and evoke emotions. Being able to share my stories and connect with readers or viewers would be incredibly fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>On the topic of the past, I have fond memories of my childhood and the adventures I had with friends and family. Exploring the outdoors, playing imaginative games, and discovering new things shaped who I am today. Reflecting on the past helps me appreciate the experiences that have shaped me and reminds me of the importance of cherishing moments with loved ones.</p><p></p><p>So, what about you? What are some of your hopes, dreams, or fond memories from the past?</p>

	- <p>We have created a fusion AI-powered trading card game where you can talk into a microphone, and it will transcribe what you say. Let's discuss the features of this game. When you look at the camera, you will see stacks of uniquely generated cards. Each card is created by an AI based on a short prompt. We have various themes for these cards, and each theme has a corresponding image and a Chat GPT Element name.</p><p></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LEJb4J7.jpeg"></p><p>For example, we have the techno symbiosis theme. Its action is to add one resource to your research resource pool. We have many other themes, but let's not delve into those details right now. The difficulty lies in the accuracy of the transcription. Currently, I am using Back Whisper, which yields better results. However, I had to remove it because it is not cross-platform compatible. Therefore, it doesn't make much sense to support it at the moment.</p><p>In summary, our card game utilizes fusion AI technology to generate unique cards based on prompts. Each card has an associated theme, image, and action. Although the transcription may not be perfect, we are working on improving it.</p><p></p><p></p>

- Fashion starts as a Sketch | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 9th, 2024]]

	- <p>I don't like how long it takes for me to figure out ideas. Too much code is written before I figure out what I wanted is not what I made. There is a bookstore near me that I frequent and on the shelf was the book <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://a.co/d/8gNqoBD">Drawing Ideas</a>. Through this book, I have come to appreciate the importance of sketching in unlocking creativity and exploring new avenues of value. Through observation and simplification, sketching allows us to see our ideas projected onto a medium, much like using our voice to sketch out thoughts verbally. However, finding people with enough social energy to engage in lengthy conversations can be challenging.</p><p>In sketching, the medium becomes the paper, freeing us from limitations like language or the energy of others. It's just us and a blank canvas, where we can let go of expectations and allow our drawings to exist as they are. Some sketches feel more "right" than others, prompting us to spend more time on them to see if they align with our original vision.</p><p>My high school art class, which I now appreciate even more, taught me valuable skills that extend beyond the classroom. Learning to draw accurately and simplify forms translates to lifelong skills in observing and understanding the world around us. It becomes evident that sketching is not simply about creating aesthetically pleasing art but also about honing our ability to perceive and interpret reality.</p><p>Living the life of an artist involves continuously seeking new ways to create value. It challenges us to redefine what "value" means and what is considered valuable. Artistic expression is, in a way, a quest to reframe societal perceptions of value. As artists, we strive to contribute to the collective consciousness by offering fresh perspectives and unconventional ideas.</p><p>Value is closely intertwined with trends and what is considered fashionable or popular at any given time. Generating value allows us to ride the wave of humanity's collective consciousness. We must accrue enough value for ourselves to reframe what people perceive as valuable. How you disperse this value into the world influences and shapes how others think and perceive the world.</p><p>In this pursuit of value creation, collaboration becomes vital. Coexisting with like-minded individuals who can contribute their unique perspectives is essential. A co-founder, for example, can provide different strengths and skills, allowing for a more robust and impactful collaboration. The two perspectives balance each other to generate immediate value while exploring intrinsic forms of value that may have been overlooked.</p><p>As I continue to explore artistic expression and the concept of value, I realize that communicating effectively is crucial. We either captivate or lose someone's full attention within a few seconds. Building reputation and trust allows us to expand that window of attention. However, it is essential to deliver high-signal content to maintain engagement consistently.</p><p>In conclusion, sketching offers a powerful way to explore ideas, unleash creativity, and find new forms of value. Whether through verbal sketches or drawings on paper, this process allows us to communicate and project our thoughts onto a medium. By embracing the act of sketching, we can let go of expectations and discover hidden depths of creativity. Through this exploration, we not only redefine value but also contribute to the collective consciousness, shaping how others perceive the world around them.</p>

- Why I am moving on from Substack | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 8th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[blog/post]]
	- <p>I had a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://bytesizedai.substack.com/">Substack</a> where I would occasionally post some things on AI. The vision was to build a following, but I couldn't execute it. There may be some "blaming the equipment, not the player" here, but from what I have learned, my writing flow feels so much better now:</p><p></p><p>First of all, I think Substack is great. Its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://substack.com/about">mission</a> is clear, and overall, they do a great job executing it (much better than Medium, imo). But there is a problem. It is a problem not unique to Substack but true for any SaaS. When anyone writes content on Substack, and clicks save, the content belongs to Substack. I am not talking about legally Substack owning the rights to content; I am talking about the words, characters, and bytes of what has been written ending up under Substack’s control. “control” can have a negative connotation so to clarify, Substack is doing an immense favor to the writer. Their content is instantly available to anyone on the Internet, they automatically send emails to subscribers, and analytics about post engagement are collected, all for free. “control” is only meant to draw attention to where the writer’s data is and who truly has access to it. For most people, I don’t think anyone cares; Substack works, and people like it, but as a programmer who wants to make cool things, it just isn’t <strong>it</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Substack’s editor is just lame. I am sorry, maybe people like it but there are so many features/tools I would like to have at my disposal when I am writing content that Substack doesn’t have. If I am straight-up writing text, it is OK, but most of the time I spend in the writing process is researching, looking at notes, talking with people, asking ChatGPT questions, and reading books. There is so much more to writing than just typing into a box. Substack isn’t alone; pretty much every platform is built to address the bare minimum of what someone might want when writing. Where are the tools to make writing more engaging? How can I channel my perception of the world more effortlessly into what I reference while writing? There is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, but again, you don’t <em>own</em> the data. Notion owns it.</p><p></p><p>A bit of an aside: I am a non-linear thinker. Ideas come and go at light speed at incredible depth and breadth. Trying to just write about AI was hell for me. Maybe it was a self-inflicted wound, but the tooling is not conducive to divergent thinking. Speaking of which, I will spare you from my mind. Please continue:</p><p></p><p>“If you care so much about owning your data, why don’t you self-host a CRM like WordPress or Ghost.” I could. You aren’t wrong. Call me a stubborn engineer, but those tools are also not <strong>it</strong>. I want to extend a CRM's capabilities and know that they will continue to work over time. Sure, WordPress has plugins, but I don’t want to write PHP (god help you if a plugin you depend on breaks). Ghost is written in Javascript. Touching someone else’s Javascript is not a pleasant experience. I also don’t think things built in Javascript last a long time. I have been playing with tools that have existed in this space for many years, and the outcome has always been the same: I move to the next one. All of them had felt good at the moment, but as soon as I crested over the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger</a> wave, I wanted something else.</p><p></p><p>So, here we are. The best tools are OK. You write, publish, see numbers, build a following, and increase numbers, and it's great you have money. I want more. I want to own my data. I want you to own your data. I want to get the fuck out of your way to build the coolest thing you can think of on the Internet. Have you spent a second looking at what people are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">building with shaders</a>? Insane. Would Substack let you embed one of these guys in there? No chance. And what about code examples? I want a full-on IDE experience in my browser so someone can teach me how to code in a blog post. I want art galleries on the Internet. I want to reach through the screen and experience something on the other side. Sites like this exist. They are the most memorable, like Bloomberg’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What is Code?</a> or Google’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/">Experiments</a>. A well-funded company can keep these works around for a while; what about your mom’s baking blog? I wonder if the provider they host it with is still around in 10 years? Maybe archive.org saved the page, but some important assets aren’t loading. Tough luck.</p><p></p><p>Well, this turned into more of a rant about liberating the Internet than I intended to, but it is where my heart lies, and hopefully, I can convince you to care about this. I am moving from Substack to just my site, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://breadchris.com">https://breadchris.com</a>, where I can control where the content comes from and goes. This site is built from the tool I have been writing, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/lunabrain-ai/lunabrain">LunaBrain</a>, which will soon be renamed JustShare because I want to just share my thoughts. If you want to follow me, subscribe to the new newsletter here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://buttondown.email/breadchris">https://buttondown.email/breadchris</a>.</p><p></p><p>Hope you have a great day, and remember to fight for what you believe in.</p><p></p>

- NYU Dropped the Ball | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 26th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[blog/post]]
	- <p>## How it went wrong</p><p>I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time. The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU. It feels disrespectful&nbsp;to all of the volunteers (you and I included) that worked so hard to not just maintain the quality of the program, but to make it 1% better every year, and make sure everything was in place for it to keep running.</p><p></p><p>The issue has stemmed from the push of making CSAW an international competition. The student&nbsp;volunteers were burdened with trying to handle this rapid&nbsp;expansion on the fly and the quality of the competition suffered. There was no longer anything "special" about CSAW since you can't have physical challenges when everything needs to be run in 10 different places. High school students and teachers all experienced this massive drop in quality and care for the competition. CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop. NYU dropped their golden egg.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the reasons I decided to drop out of NYU. I was being offered a fantastic job at Uber, while having to fight to try to keep the security lab that special place that made it what it was. We weren't able to have a two time HSF finalist get accepted into NYU. Most finalists don't even consider going to NYU as they usually have their sights set on CMU, MIT, etc. A friend of mine, a three time finalist, only decided to go because he would be&nbsp;*paid*&nbsp;to go to NYU. Another friend would also have been paid, but decided to go elsewhere.</p><p>- There is no competition on the planet that embraces the spirit of HSF (as it was). CTFs encourage a fire and forget mentality, once you have learned the patterns you need to learn. In fighting to preserve the HSF format, I was&nbsp;repeatedly told that HSF would not scale, and that was the reason why it became a CTF for highschoolers.</p><p></p><p>I wrote this challenge generator, partially out of frustration, to prove that it was possible to scale a competition that encourages cohesive problem solving skills. And even more importantly, it teaches students how to communicate the work that they have done and rewards them for spending that time. The ex-HSF finalists that I still stay in communication with, who remember how HSF was, are frothing at the mouth at the idea of this competition coming back.</p><p></p><p>My dream with rebooting HSF is to preserve the "magic" that you feel when you spend a week perusing the evidence, only to look at something for the 10th time and see what you were missing. Or being at finals and being given a phone and a "good luck". You were the one who showed me how special this competition was. We had facetime, as highschoolers, with real government agents doing this for a living.</p><p></p><p>I want to have a package that I can give to a community college that has a teacher that cares about cyber security, and show them how to run this for themselves. If we want to improve the cyber security talent pipeline, we have to fight to find those sleeping creative thinkers and give them a sanctuary&nbsp;to practice the dark arts of cyber security. NYU did not fight for this sanctuary, and the program suffered.</p><p></p><p>The reason I am so passionate about this competition is that it literally has made me who I am. When I applied to colleges, I applied to 13 colleges&nbsp;and only got into UMD and NYU. UMD gave me no scholarship money (even though I gave a presentation to the senior class of UMD's Cyber Aces program, sponsored by Northrup Grumman, on what it was like to intern there since I had interned at NG for two years). NYU didn't just give me money for being a finalist, but I talked to Joy (the year before she was let go) and she cared enough to make it remotely financially feasible for me to go there. CSAW brought the best high school/collegiate cyber security talent into the same room, for multiple days, every year. The roommates that I live with are HSF finalists. Because of CSAW, a national network of introverts has been solidified and is bringing the future of cyber security, and I reap the benefits of it.</p>

- I hacked your site. |

	- <p>It isn't your fault, you were just doing your job. Even if you wanted to try to stop it, there isn't much you, as an individual, could do about it. Either I or someone else who vaguely understands how to code was going to hack you like this. Business requirements for shipping that feature out at lighting speed for your largest customer last quarter made this all too easy.</p><p>```js</p><p>const asdf = () =&gt; {}</p><p>```</p><p>Your company's site uses javascript. It has a package.json that's filled with dependencies. It is probably fair to say you are using at least one of the top 1000 most popular javascript packages. Go ahead, find one that you use: select package -&gt; package X</p><p></p><p>So let's take a look at package X. It has N lines of code and is maintained by M number of maintainers. But wait, there is more. What about the packages package X depends on? Well, it turns out there are D of them. And if you were to consider all of the maintainers of those packages, there are M' of them. Pretty wild.</p><p></p><p>Why would you care about this? Well let me lay out a scenario.</p><p>Let's say I am a hacker that wanted to hack your company. Knowing that your company's site uses package X, I can have some fun with your site. If it isn't obvious, package X's code and all of packages it depends on code all have _full access_ to your site. That means they could run whatever code they wanted to. Credit card number is entered into a form? Sounds juicy. Maybe I just want to show all your users some dancing cats. I'm sure they would love that. Let's go and do that.</p><p></p><p>Well, most of package X and its dependencies have their code hosted on Github and I have fabricated what looks to be a reputable account here. Look at me, such an outstanding open source contributor.</p><p></p><p>One of the packages that X depends on is package Y.</p><p></p><p>Package Y has N open issues for bug fixes or feature requests and I am sure they could use some help with some code. I'll spend a few hours to work on some code to resolve issue # and I'll send it over to package Y's maintainers. It might look like this.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately I made quick work of this issue because I had a helpful library lying around that did most of the work for me. I feel like my changes are pretty reasonable and it would be a no brainer for a maintainer to accept this code. Maybe there are a few tweaks to make, but odds are pretty good I can get that code landed.</p><p></p><p>Cool, so when my code gets landed, the maintainer will cut a new release at some point and my code will be running in your company's site once you bump your version or blow away your package lock like you normally do.</p><p></p><p>What are the odds the maintainer actually looked at that dependency I added? How often do you spend a single second looking at the package you are about to include into your app? If you are a good developer, I would give you a minute of looking at the docs, API, maybe the tests. But have you _really_ scanned through all the files? Did you check the `scripts` section of `package.json`? I sure as hell don't do this for every package I install, let alone all the other packages it installs. How can I when my manager is breathing down my neck?</p><p></p><p>Ok, ok, lets say you really are the engineer of the year and you poked and proded my PR and checked out the source code for the library I added. If you haven't go ahead and look, I'll wait. I would expect that your search hasn't actually turned up anything that could be considered "malware". Maybe you found a bug, but errornous lines don't really matter to me when I am stealing passwords from your users.</p><p></p><p>The malicious code isn't in the source code, it's in _NPM_. Before I release a version of my dependency to the npm registry, I tack on a little more javascript. You would only see this javascript if you were to directly download the dependency and open it up (link). Didn't see that one coming did ya? I made the JS obvious here, but what if it looked more like this: xxx Is that easier to read?</p><p></p><p>You might laugh at this attack vector, "wow great, you are going to land some code and then a year from now when we bump our package version you can hack our site". Well, the thing is I already have spent a year doing this to your site. I fingerprinted the dependencies that your site has from your source maps and script tags. I've been resolving issues like this for the past year, and you don't have the slightest idea which dependencies are actually trojan horses for my exploit code.</p><p></p><p>"Why would I ever accept your PR? It includes an unnecessary dependency! If I were that maintainer, I would tell you to write those lines yourself." Well, if you think that way, you obviously aren't a javascript developer. Micropackages are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.chevtek.io/why-i-think-micro-packages-are-a-good-thing/">encouraged</a>. That is how development is done in Javascript land. In fact, take a look at this graph showing how many packages Package X has included over time:</p><p></p><p>Most Stack Overflow answers to Javascript developers has at least one person suggesting to use a package to fix the problem. Maybe I will start suggesting my own packages as answers to questions...</p><p></p><p>Oh also, this isn't hypothetical, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">it has already happened</a>. Bitpay was targeted by this attack, and the hacker was only caught because he called a deprecated function that node printed a warning about. Knowing how they got caught, only make my malware stronger.</p><p>It doesn't take an experienced hacker or really anyone with any security experience to do this. In fact, a regular developer would probably be more equipped that me to execute this attack because they probably know those weird forgotten about packages better than me.</p><p></p><p>You know what, next time I hack your site, I am not going to wait around for some developer to accept my PR. I wonder how hard it would be to find a developer who is down on their luck and offer them a good amount of money, a hard earned wage, in exchange for them including my library in their project to help me "get my feet off the ground" as a fellow developer applying for jobs.</p><p></p><p>We know this attack is happening, and us at LunaSec are building the future of protection from this type of attack. We aren't waiting around for some security researcher to raise the next alarm and deal with the fire drill of responding to these incidents. No, we are automatically _eradicating_ this problem by using our knowledge as security researchers _and_ developers to design an intelligent, automated system that silently protects you and your company's code.</p>

- How I Got to Where I Am |

	- <p>So i was in a really good high school&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolesville_High_School">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolesville_High_School</a>&nbsp;and so there would be some ridiculously smart people who would work on things and because the program was so close knit, information would disseminate between the grades and so the younger group of kids would only get that much better. I got involved in cyber security because the older kids competed in a competition that was for hacking and they did very well. So I strived to be like them and compete in competitions. Note that around this time CTFs were gaining traction, but hadn't quite got to the high schoolers yet. So the competition that I got brought up on was Brooklyn Polytechnic (now&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Tandon_School_of_Engineering)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Tandon_School_of_Engineering</a> CSAW HSF (High School Forensics). It was a month long competition for high schoolers where the first round you had to spend a month looking at NCIS-like cyber forensics data online (go to fake website clones of facebook to look at someone's profile, they link to an image they took, image has EXIF data in it that has the next bit of evidence). So this competition was so cool that me and my friends were finalists for the competition. It was so cool, not only did you get an all expenses paid for trip to New york city to compete in finals, you got to also interact with all the other ridiculously smart finalists. They were from all over the country and they were all so cool that we ended up connecting our online social networks with them. A number of my friends today were finalists from that competition, including my roommate. They don't run this competition anymore because of politics, but I am trying to keep it alive with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/CTFg/CTFg">https://github.com/CTFg/CTFg</a>.</p><p></p><p>This jump started my social network so my friends and I were now networked with the best cyber security people in the US going into college. The college I went to had a cyber security lab (OSIRIS LAB, you have to play a CTF to get admission into the lab, it is pretty cool). It was a place to hang out between classes and work on cyber security stuff (like CTFs, hacking hardware, talking about semantics of programming) like some serious nerds here lol. There were leadership opportunities which meant that I could learn how to be better at organizing people to work on tasks together (which was something i enjoyed). One of those leadership opportunities was running the very same competition that I got into college with, HSF. I was able to take all of the things I learned while playing the competition, and implement them in a competition that every kid in America would get a chance to play with, how cool was that. The mentors that I had helping me put this together were top notch, some of the best roll models to follow in the footsteps of (they are all amazing people who live great lives).</p><p></p><p>I leveraged this lab's network to get me my internships. I worked at BAE systems for two years doing static code analysis to look for 0day vulnerabilities in a product they were using. I then got to intern at Uber which completely changed my life, once again.</p><p></p><p>Working at Uber let me see what choosing the "right" things really, really fast looked like. They were operating at such massive scale when I joined. The project I got hired onto only had a manager. Literally an intern and a manager. And together we built out the entire mobile security team. Our code is still run on every phone that has Uber downloaded and it is responsible for saving Uber the 20% of revenue that they lost to fraud. Millions and millions of dollars.</p><p></p><p>Understanding my impact to the world let me feel confident enough to join @Free Wortley (a coworker of mine from Uber) to work on Refinery. He derisked my decision to jump ship of a well paying job (without a college degree since I dropped out), to get paid way less, but on an opportunity that could change my life. We didn't use our security skills for the first product we were working on, so we changed to developing LunaDefend. This is a project was a work of love. It took the biggest problems that we saw at the other silicon valley companies in regards to security and solved it with this security framework. Unfortunately selling a dev tool is only something that you can do when you have hit a homerun of a product idea, and we just didnt quite get there. ...and then came the big one.</p><p></p><p>As I was walking out the door to go work from the day at free's, @alex told me about a chinese blog that was talking about a vulnerability in a widely used java library. I thought that was interesting, and drove off. Later that day Free and I were talking about what we could write about that might help us solve our SEO problem. What really cool blog post could we write about that would wow HN. I told Free about what alex had told me and we thought about it for a while. How many projects use Log4j? How hard is it to exploit this vulnerability? What could you do if you exploited this? ... wait minecraft kids are using this to crash servers with a chat box message? Could this really be as bad as we think it is? Are we living through the worst vulnerability that has ever happened to the internet?</p><p></p><p>Turns out, yes, we absolutely were experiencing this thing for real. While this wasn't actually a zero day (there was a version out with a fix) the communication of the vulnerability was lagging so hard that the chinese blog poster actually was looking at the github commit made to patch the vulnerability and writing about it on his own personal blog. This is what alex translated and read to me that morning. We poured over every single ounce of information that we could get our hands on. Pulling up the log4j code. Making a POC of the exploit. Our blog post had links to tweets that others had made.</p><p></p><p>Our blog post gets popular on HN, but it isn't the first result on the page. At the top was another blog post that someone had submitted. Looking at it, it wasn't really that clear as to what you were supposed to do to fix the issue. Our blog post had everything someone responding from it would have dreamt of. It was clear, concise and most importantly accurate. This quality of work earned us the opportunity of an HN mod replacing the top link of HN to ours.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, we kept the blog up to date as more information became available to us through our vast social network that we now became in tune with. Asking the right questions and making the advice from the community as clear and actionable as possible.</p>

- A Sustainable Thinker Always Wins |

	- <p>You can think about a lot of different things all the time. Think about too many things and this becomes a serious problem, especially for those who have ADD. If you have a problem focusing on which idea to pursue, it is easy to experience the feeling of being lost. Life is happening, ideas come and go, but there is nothing for you to bring to show and tell.</p><p>I am not an expert in this field of study, but I do pay attention to what constitutes a “great thinker”. Or maybe a better term for the people I am thinking about is “sustainable thinker”.</p><p></p><p>## Patience</p><p>A sustainable thinker is one who has, above everything else, patience. An idea will come and go, and it will not phase them. Instead, they take note of it. Often times a physical note, in a place that they frequently take their notes. There is organization to the way they take in information. Over time, these observations grow and connections are formed between new observations and older observations. Higher level concepts are synthesized. It becomes effortless to understand an entire domain of information. But it doesn’t stop there. To them this actually might be the beginning of what they consider “having an idea”. They take their hypothesis wherever they go. To the best of their ability, they will try to find data to suggest what they believe isn’t true.</p><p></p><p>## Reading</p><p>A sustainable thinker reads. Often times long form text like books or insightful blogs. There is a purpose to how and what they read. But a very important point here is that these people are not machines that solely exist to consume well thought out content day in/day out. No, these are still humans who enjoy memes and bingeing mindless TV. See, a patient thinker understands the bigger picture. They are human on a planet of humans. Not everyone is like them, and so everyone has something to share. Being able to interact with actual humans through colloquial phrases and honest emotional communication is vital. Honoring the give and take of time and energy that comes with existing is paramount to a sustainable thinker.</p><p></p><p>## Align with Sustainable Thinkers</p><p>I try to align myself with the patient thinkers I am fortunate enough to interact with. I find it an immense privilege to be able to ask questions of these people. It makes me feel rewarded to be able to provide well researched insight of my own to my peers.</p><p></p><p>I probably still have too many threads of thought I pull at every day, but I think I am on to something. I kind of have this master plan for what I am working on, but I also realize it will take time. I need to be patient and continue to be present and honest with myself. Through this practice, I have felt immensely rewarded even for doing the smallest of things, like writing a single note for a given day.</p><p></p><p>Regardless if you are or strive to be a sustainable thinker, I wish you all the best on your journey through your own mind 🙏</p>

- Start with a Static Site | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 26th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[blog/post]]
	- <p>Ok, there is just simply way too much shit that you have to learn to host a freaking website . Let’s make that easier.</p><p></p><p>Start with Markdown and hugo. Markdown is trivial to learn and making a website is instant. Hugo is a single binary you download, run and boom there is your website. A number of themes are available for you to check out and play with, but they aren’t necessary to start out.</p><p></p><p>If you want to have more control over how things are formatted and roughly look, html will be the next step of learning. By itself, it will be relatively limited, but you can get pretty far with including a simple CSS style sheet like this one.</p><p></p><p>If you want to move things around on the page, make them bigger/smaller, red/blue. You are going to need to learn CSS. As you learn more about CSS, you should consider playing with css libraries like bootstrap or tailwindcss which will greatly scale up your abilities as you try to do more complicated and coordinated visual things.</p><p></p><p>When you want things on the page to move around things, you are going to want to learn Javascript. There is a lot that you can do with javascript. Understanding that a webpage is a tree of nested objects with names and identifiers will be important to spend time on. The internet will try to convince you that you need to know React, Angular, Vue, but you just don’t need it right now. These are javascript frameworks that really let you do some crazy things, but stay simple as long as you can. Once you find yourself needing to model a bunch of data on a page, I would recommending learning the javascript framework Svelte. Of all the frameworks, it is, in my opinion, the closest framework to the knowledge you already know about html, css, javascript.</p><p></p><p>If you have learned about html, css, and javascript, you are probably already building some cool things. You can still run the same hugo command and generate your website and not needing to think about much. But maybe you want to store data so it doesn’t go away when you refresh the page. If this is the case, you are going to want to build a backend. A backend is complimentary to your frontend as it runs as its own process and listens for requests your frontend sends to it. If you took my advice and learned Svelte, they have a super easy way to build a backend called SvelteKit. If you went with React, there is the great option of NextJS. If you haven’t learned either of these, you will probably want to learn about express and how to build REST api endpoints.</p><p></p><p>If you are feeling pretty good about all of this, then you are well on your way for some serious application development. These are the things that every application developer does every day at their company and you have your own foothold into this whole market. You are super valuable as a result. Look at all the things you know! You must have spent a ton of time looking at the internet for help on building these things and someone will pay for that. Good luck out there!</p>

If someone has done it, then someone might come along and decide to continue to do it in a similar way. All successful programming languages have a following of individuals who follow standards outlined by the language.

The more patterns that emerge in code, the easier it is for an AI to replicate these patterns. The "clever" developer comes up with hack after hack and more often than not writes code which they are only capable of comprehending. Since these are "clever" solutions which demonstrate a deep understanding of the tool being used, an AI might have a harder time arriving at the same solution.</p><p></p><p>But with Legos, it is quite difficult to bend the rules.&nbsp;*Insert meme of stepping on lego*. I mean, they are physically quite hard and not designed to bend. As a result, those who play with Legos are much more capable of seeing, reverse engineering, and repeating patterns they see when building sets or looking at other's builds. There are no secrets, there are rarely any surprises, just consistent creative thinking.</p><p></p><p>## [](https://github.com/breadchris/notes/blob/001dbbef6dc23ce5349baf7b39e98536da9270f1/pages/We%20need%20Legos%20for%20Code.md#legos-as-code) Legos as Code</p><p></p><p>It makes sense why we don't have coding Legos, it is really hard to build. We are constantly pushing the boundary of what computers are capable of doing every day.

Short of showing up to a datacenter, I am not sure how I can physically interact with my data or code. I have to rely one documentation of features, trial and error to see what works or doesn't. It seems far too often I have to become an expert in an entire cloud technology before I actually reap the amazing benefits of it.

Oh right, some of the largest video games in the world Minecraft and Roblox.</p><p></p><p>The thing is, we have written enough applications to know exactly&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://supabase.com/">what is needed</a>&nbsp;to take most ideas and scale them up to be legitimate businesses.

- What holds us back | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 26th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[blog/post]]
	- <p>I don’t know if I personally would say that my life has been “hard”. I hear people use this to describe their life; “I have fallen on hard times”. But I don’t know, it doesn’t seem to be a relatable feeling. I have had to solve “hard” problems. Whether it is a math problem with seemingly random symbols or trying to comprehend why my parents won’t get along with each other.</p><p></p><p>I think I would say my life has been “challenging” and I try my best to work every day to make it less challenging in certain ways so I can make room for challenges that I actually want. If something happens with a friend where we aren’t communicating well, I try my best to resolve this problem. I do this because I know I won’t be able to focus on writing the code I want. I want to be challenged by code, I don’t want to be challenged by emotions.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately for me, it seems that I have a pretty good idea about how to tackle emotions. I like to think that I have been blessed by an innate ability to see and understand patterns, as well as having environments in my life that have made me feel safe and secure. In high school I was in an incredible school program for nerds, in college I was a part of a student run cyber security lab, I dropped out of school to work at Uber with Phds and other drop outs who all had incredible passion for the work they did. Ever since high school, I have been a part of at least one group who made me feel _seen_ for who I was.</p><p></p><p>When I talk at length with my friends and peers about how they are doing, I grow more and more surprised? shocked? with every conversation. It is obviously purely qualitative, but goddamn, it seems like everyone experiences some degree of depression? Even my friends who permanently have a smile on their face, same thing, some type of perpetual sadness.</p><p></p><p>I want to be very careful when addressing this because:</p><p>1) I don’t want to seem oblivious, yes I see how much pain there is in the world</p><p>2) Insensitive to people’s very real feelings of depression</p><p>3) Make those reading this to feel like I am saying “haha you have depression and I don’t”. I am very sensitive to other’s feelings around me, and it makes me sad that others so close to me experience this.</p><p></p><p>The thing is I just simply don’t experience what people describe when they describe depression. It is sometimes hard to get out of bed in the morning, but it has never seemed “impossible” as people have described. Days haven’t passed where it feels like I have done “nothing important”. Reflecting on my life, I realize I have unintentionally been trying to solve these feelings for others my whole life. Most namely my parent’s. Playing counselor for their shouting matches has left me with two things: an intuitive ability to speak non-confrontationally, but also a deep complex I have around trying to solve other’s problems.</p><p></p><p>These things have significantly affected my life and being able to address feelings in a productive way has been something you can’t even begin to put a price on. This deep vulnerability however, has been something I have struggled with, most notably in regards to close friendships and romantic ones. I have fought really hard with myself to over come this, but at the end of the day the true force that got me out of these situations is simply one thing; my support system.</p><p></p><p>My friends, family, co-workers, even regular people I would see at boxing or the skate park. These are the people who showed me what love and respect should look like. Just before I went through a really tough breakup I was able to visit with a number of friends and what hit me, I’m talking a real “hitting me like a brick” scenario, was that how I feel around my good friends is how I should always be feeling. I feel safe and secure around these people, I can be myself, who made me feel _seen_. Well then why would I ever be around someone who wasn’t making me feel that way? The math just didn’t add up.</p><p></p><p>There is an amazing book that I try to get people to read. It is incredibly terse so I understand if you don’t want to read it. Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam looks at how social life in the US has changed over time. The TL;DR is that groups and physical spaces where people would congregate are significantly declining as people find their social connections becoming more digital. Sitting in front of the radio listening to cowboy westerns, became watching them on TV, and now you watch a new western every month on your phone. This may seem like an obvious point, but an important one. Digital relationships are different. You can’t get hugged from across the Internet in a way that someone from a support group could do if you break down crying. Deeply human activities like exercising are limited. It becomes a lot easier to bully a faceless victim with words, which in turn forces victims into safe spaces which almost inevitably become echo chambers of emotion. I said “different” for a reason. Digital relationships are not inherently bad. I have built many relationships from various chat rooms (granted I have always made it a point to meet with them physically, eventually). The most compelling argument for how a digital presence is actually incredibly positive can be found in this documentary about VR chat.</p><p></p><p>This pain I discover in so many people is what is holding us back. No, I am not trying be profound here, I am just stating a fact. How can we be collectively working towards “the perfect thing”, whatever that may be, when there is so much unaccounted pain day to day? Universally embracing mental health has become so painfully obvious to me as what we should be investing in understanding, and yet the research in the field of psychology is underwhelming. My girlfriend, who studied psychology, explained to me that there was this research who proved that the results of most psychology studies up until some point were not satisfactory. This single study essentially reversed decades of work. The study of psychedelics has been something that has interested me greatly. The ability to visualize these things that hold us back sounds so incredibly powerful to me and they are actually effective at curing depression! I’ll save my thoughts on this for another post, I think I should probably end this one 🤣</p><p></p><p>There is only one thing I want you to walking away from this post thinking about. I want you to think about the ways that you feel seen and what you do to make others feel seen. This might seem incredibly confusing, but just think about it next time you are in a group of friends. What does someone do that makes you feel good? Do they smile at you? Remember something important about you? Do you like the inside jokes you have with each other? Perhaps you realize you actually don’t feel seen by your friends. Maybe a friend says something that makes your chest tighten. Perhaps you realize you can’t share something important about yourself with everyone because people would laugh. I really believe if we want to start healing from the “things that hold us back” we have to be conscious about these things about ourselves. Good luck out there! Life is freaking hard man 🤣</p>

- Why soundbite should exist | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 26th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[blog/post]]
	- <p>TL;DR soundbite is a podcasting platform, supercharged by advancements in content discovery, to connect with your friends and your community before international influencers.</p><p></p><p>Authenticity is a commodity in modern day communication. When we wake up, we look at our phone, during breakfast, we look at our phone, at work when we are bored, we look at our phone, going to the bathroom? phone. Watching TV? phone. Avoiding going to bed? phone. It is the first and last thing we look at every day.</p><p></p><p>What do we spend our day doing on the phone? Catching up with some celebrity, social media influencer, some random hair salon that cuts hair with fire. "The algorithm" is really good at what it does, and what it is doing is keeping you on the platform by any means necessesary. If you spend a second longer than usual fixated on a some guy lifting a lot of weight your digital content butler is going to start serving you videos of weightlifters. The faster the algorithm can glean information about your engagement with the content, the more it is able to zero in on what they can fill your limited attention span with before you get ripped away and placed in front of someone else's visually, auditorially engaging world built more and more just for you.</p><p></p><p>As a developer, I am enthralled with how effective this algorithm is. And what is even more interesting is just how simple it is to build. Every major social media platform has their own form of "short form content" available for you to use and the numbers speak for themselves. Or even better, don't look at the numbers, just start using it yourself and feel just how targeted you get by spending very little time on any platform (tiktok's is scary good).</p><p></p><p>In essence, we have invented digital crack. A pure refinement on what "engagement" is. The doom sayers will tell you it is mind control, and I will generally agree. Actually, I completely agree, but I personally like to think that all mind control has its applications in humanity in a way that actually benefits us. I guess it is just the teacher in me that wants to connect with students in interesting ways and any good teacher is trying to do this every day already. Unfortunately, engagement that comes from "Answer this and get some candy" or "spend more time on the assignment and get extra credit" is not very effective or it really only will work a couple of times before the gig is up. Engaging content really comes from one's ability to observe the student, understand their world, and then know what it is that you can say or do that will coax them into walking into your world and seeing what you have to offer. Creators on Tiktok, and the like, really can do this quite easily once they figure out the forumla (which is "shared" by other creators who they follow), and often times it is really just acting out the all too potent and powerful primal desires we have. Girls showing off their boobs, men flexing, violence, romance, comedy, etc. Well, I should really say this type of content is what will go viral. There is so much content being uploaded to these platforms it is easy to miss the true home grown creativity that people, deep down, really do crave. The unapologetic, authentic content that comes from creators who care about their content and not the views it might have. When people get the creative freedom they crave, magic is made.</p><p></p><p>I have made an observation of my surroundings that has become undeniable to me, and I walk into every conversation I have with this thought banging around in my head. No matter who I am talking to, I am finding myself realizing that there are nuggets of valuable information that are constantly being dropped. A good conversation is one that seems to effortlessly till someone's mind and surface a part of them that they might not have talked about in a while. With the right questions, you can guide someone through their own mind and remind them about concepts and ideas that make them, them. And someone being themselves is not an easy thing to do. There is a lot of life that is lived between then and now. All of that time in between might be filled with things that seem insignificant to the speaker, but to the listener, that might be exactly what they need to experience to alter their perception fo the world.</p><p>I think almost everyone has had this experience, but think back to a classroom experience you had with a "bad teacher". A "bad teacher", in my opinion is simply a teacher who just couldn't connect with you in the way that you needed to be connected with. Now, and hopefully you have had this experience, a "good teacher" is one who just always seems to say the things that make you consider what they are talking about for a moment longer. The information percolates throughout your mind and starts to alter your assumptions. Finding the right teacher for you can be incredibly difficult. Someone who can speak your language, not just English, Spanish, Chinese, etc. but the colloquial words you have come to speak so that you can feel seen for who you are, that can be difficult.</p><p></p><p>The case for soundbite begins and ends with a simple idea; we need to feel seen before we can learn. There is so much stimulation around us digitally that the next wave of advancements in communication are going to feel like regressions in technology, but in reality they are focused on solving the much more complicated problems that we, as humans and not just consumers, face.</p>

The concept is almost always done with two fingers, but can get increasingly complex with implementation of all 10 fingers.</p><p>                - Dialing increases finger independence and is an incredibly versatile concept that can be used in almost any situation.

Typically only a few lights are left on at a time and then transferred from finger-to-finger by clicking one light off and the other one on. The effect this gives is one of pure magic, as the glover is able to make lights disappear and reappear in a flash</p><p>                - Conjuring you gain knowledge of the viewers focal point, and they are also good practice for mode changes.

Mode changing is effective for accenting speed control, like when glovers switch to a blinky set during slow, more technical times, and switching to a much more trail inducing set during faster motions.</p><p>                - Mode changing keeps your viewer on the edge of their seat. Knowing how the modes on your lights are laid out is crucial for this technique, as you must be able to anticipate what’s coming next. Simple things like changing colors or patterns really introduce a wow factor for your viewers, as it is often unexpected.</p><p>        - Who Uses It</p><p>                - Flow</p><p>                - Materia</p><p>                - Ice Kream Teddy</p><p>- #### The Grid</p><p>        - Details</p><p>                - A structured representation of the space in front of you. The Grid takes into account forward and backward, left and right, and up and down motions and sections them off equally into a 3D boxed pattern.</p><p>                - An absolute necessity for any glover. Knowledge of the Grid helps build&nbsp;spatial awareness and is used for accurate and precise placement of almost any move.</p>

	- <p>- I have worked for Northrup Grumman and Uber as a security engineer and I built security tools that have been used around the world. The coolest thing that I have done in my life is that I got to help develop code that ran on every device that had Uber installed on it. The purpose of this code was to help the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/uber-fights-off-scammers-every-day-heres-how-it-learned-the-tricks/">20% Uber was losing to fraudulent trips</a>. The talent needed to work on a project like this was so rare that I was hired on as the first team member, as an intern and later hired on as a college dropout. This is not to toot my own horn, but it is to make a point: being a "hacker" is rare and it might be one of the most powerful skills in the age of computers.</p><p>- I am going to show you, verbatim, of what I wrote when I graduated high school. No one else knew about this besides who might have, allegedly, worked with me. An important note on this, this all happened before I knew that cyber security competitions existed.</p><p>- ## How I hacked my school</p><p>- ### Fucking Cool Stuff</p><p>  </p><p>  So with these stories, I am entrusting you with our wrong doings at PHS and if you choose to tell others about these shenanigans I would appreciate you use anonymity as a member of our team is still in PHS and I would rather the word not have a chance of spreading and the person getting in trouble haha thanks.</p><p>- #### **Part 1 - Getting Administrative Access on All the Computers In the School**</p><p>  </p><p>  So in Windows, to be able to change everything about the operating system, your user account must have the privileges of an Administrator user. Our student accounts are pretty limited, only allowing us access to certain programs and saving and opening files in a pretty restricted area on the computer. Naturally, we wanted to get complete control of the computers because we were bored haha. Before they upgraded the computers to Windows 7, this process was pretty easy. So we knew about a way to get the next best thing to the computer’s password and that is the password hashes using a tool called Ophcrack (Appendix A 7). A password hash is better explained here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1602776/what-is-password-hashing">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1602776/what-is-password-hashing</a> but it is basically a way to store a password on a computer so that if someone were to find the password hash on the computer (like we did) they would not just be able to read the password like they would read plain text (so instead of a computer storing “password” as the user’s password on the computer, they would be storing “5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99” (if they were using the MD5 hashing algorithm (there are a lot of different hashing algorithms that generate different combinations of numbers and letters, MD5 is just one of them))). So in order to use Ophcrack, we changed the computer’s BIOS (You know when you turn on your computer and you see like “Press f2” or something like that? If you press f2 when the computer is booting up you can change your own comuter’s bios settings :D) ([http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios.htm](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios.htm)) so that when the computer was looking for an Operating system to boot into, it would first look at the flash drive that we had attached to the computer and checked if they flash drive had an Operating system on it (Ophcrack is considered a linux operating system based off of the Debian distrobution). Once the computer recognized our attached USB as having Ophcrack, Ophcrack would then be able to scan for the place on the hard drive where Windows stores its password hashes (Ophcrack is able to do this without worrying about not have the right permissions to access the passwords because it is using Linux and Linux has a different way it handles permissions and thus it completely ignores any permissions that the Windows operating system has on its files :D pretty cool huh?). So once Ophcrack gave us the password hashes we needed, we did this thing called a Rainbow Table lookup (no we are not checking to see if the passwords are gay or not haha). You can read more about rainbow tables here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/">http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/</a> but basically since the password hashing algorithm will give vary different output in a small difference in the password (try it for yourself: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php)">http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php</a> it is impossible to simply deduce what the password is when you are only given the hash. Rainbow tables effectively break password hashing for fairly simple passwords (ie if there are only letters and numbers and it is smaller than 14 characters) because they are made in order to associate a specific password it a correlating hash (so these rainbow tables have the hash for password, password1, password2, password3, … and the person with the password hash only needs to find where their hash is in the table and get the password that it is associated with). Because this is MCPS, they do not have good password security and thus we found the password as a 6 digit alphanumeric string (alphabet and number characters only). And because the admin password is the same on all the computers, we had admin access on every single computer and had full control over all of them :D</p><p>- #### **Part 2 - Dealing with the Windows 7 upgrade**</p><p>  </p><p>  So MCPS got a little smarter when they upgraded their OS from XP to 7 because they password protected the BIOS so that we were not able to change it (They also changed the admin password so our old one did not work). This did not stop us however :D So we did some research and discovered that the BIOS is really just a part on the computer’s motherboard that has to always be kept on (if you knew electrical engineering this would make sense due to the actual hardware logical gates having to store electrical charges but CS people don’t really care about that stuff haha). So this part on the motherboard is powered by a small battery called the CMOS battery ([http://www.allabouthappylife.com/acer_ferrari_5000/acer_ferrari_5000_detach-rtc-battery.jpg](http://www.allabouthappylife.com/acer_ferrari_5000/acer_ferrari_5000_detach-rtc-battery.jpg)). If this battery were to lose power or be unplugged, any settings that were changed by the user in the BIOS would be reset (:D). So you could only guess how happy we&nbsp; were to find this out. The next day we found an isolated computer lab, opened up a computer, pulled the battery out and put it back in then used Ophcrack to find that they still had a 6 character alpha numeric password (they never learn). And that was that :D</p><p>- #### **Part 3 - The School’s Wifi Password**</p><p>  </p><p>  Our motive for this was pretty obvious, we saw there was a wifi access point and we wanted to use it :D So going about solving this problem, we had to think about the ways we could gain access to it. It was secured with WPA2 encryption and unlike previous versions of wifi encryption like WPA and WEP, WPA2 is able to be cracked. So we could not remotely get the wifi password, we would need physical access to a device. Our first thought was since every router that was broadcasting the wifi signal was connected to a central router that had the password we could attempt to go into the ceiling, attach a lan cable into the router in the ceiling (those white things with green blinking lights) and then locate the main router on the network and rest the password. There were two problems with this approach as first getting access to something in the ceiling was pretty conspicuous and if someone turned the corner and saw us, we would have a hard time explaining and then secondly we did not know if we could actually find out the pre existing password or if we would have to reset the password which would then cause Mrs.Hackey to be all like WTF someone changed the wifi password and then we could also be caught. So we needed a physical device that was not conspicuous to obtain that is using the wifi network. Our answer was in the Mac laptops as they were 1) connected to the wifi network and 2) able to be obtained in a classroom setting. So getting our hands on a macbook we discovered that you had to be admin on the macbook to view the wifi password so you know what we did? Made ourselves admin :D So with almost any OS you can reset the admin password if the security settings are not changed to prevent that (this is MCPS of course they did not set the right settings :D) so we did this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4913069?tstart=0">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4913069?tstart=0</a> **boom **logged in and got the password **snap** :D</p><p>- #### **Part 4 - Getting access to all of the security cameras**</p><p>  </p><p>  So you can see our collection of images in Appendix A 8 (it is not complete because there are different models of cameras and the program we made did not account for the authentication method for the other model of camera so we were not able to get all the cameras but this is still a pretty good list :D). So this little project was a little more advanced in the sense that we had to use our knowledge about computer networking to do what we wanted to do. So we figured that there was no way that the cameras were directly connected to like a central computer with wires because that would take up way too much wire so they were more likely connected to the routers scattered around the ceilings. And since the routers are all on the wifi network, that meant that the cameras were on it too. Now the tricky part in this is determining what subnet (or sub-network: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://blog.codepath.com/2011/11/15/what-are-subnets/)">http://blog.codepath.com/2011/11/15/what-are-subnets/</a> all of the cameras were on. So when we connected our computers to the network, the network has to issue out IP addresses to our computers so it could identify our computers on the network and keep track of who was who. And since we were given IP addresses in the form 192.168.1.[0-255] we thought that maybe the cameras were in somewhere buried in another subnet like 192.168.2.0/16 or 192.168.3.0/16 (this will make more sense if you read the SANS thing on networking or do some Googling on subnets and i can answer any questions you have about them). So how we would check to see if the cameras were on a subnet is do this thing called a Ping Sweep. In a ping sweep we are essentially trying any possible combination of IP address in a particular subnet and issuing a Ping command on it. What ping is is a small message that is sent from one computer to another destination across a network in order to tell if something exists at that IP address. But in our attempts we did hear back from any of our ping requests and thus we concluded that there were no cameras on that subnet. After some time of experimentation we realized something important. So since the schools network is self contained, it is considered to be private. Private IPv4 addressing is explained here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/privateipaddr.htm">http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/privateipaddr.htm</a> but what you need to know for this is that private IPv4 has 3 different subnets that it uses, 10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0. and 192.168.0.0. When we connected our computers, we were on 192.168.0.0 but had not tested the other two subnets. So doing our Ping Sweep again, we found them. When our computer lit up with Ping responses from the 172.16.0.0 subnet, we were so siced. Now that we knew where they were, we needed access to them. We knew they were IQeye so we did some research as to how they worked. We found a document that would later, after we got access to the cameras, be pretty funny ([http://www.iqeye.com/sites/default/files/mcps_case_study.pdf](http://www.iqeye.com/sites/default/files/mcps_case_study.pdf)) as well as there being a login web page that could be accessed for each camera that authorized a user that had the correct username and password. After trying the default username and password, we were not successful and concluded that MCPS wasn’t entirely insecure. Doing some more research we hit the jackpot. We found a document ([https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Heffner-Exploiting-Network-Surveillance-Cameras-Like-A-Hollywood-Hacker-WP.pdf)](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Heffner-Exploiting-Network-Surveillance-Cameras-Like-A-Hollywood-Hacker-WP.pdf_)which had found an exploit in the IQeye cameras that returned the username and password hash of the account which you used to log in. Performing this exploit gave us what we needed and we then proceeded to break the password hash which, whatdoyahknow, was an extremely basic password, “mcps_152.” 152, that was a familiar number, where had I seen that before? Talking with my team we realized that it was Poolesville’s school code. I had forgotten to metion earlier that in our Ping sweep, we did a sweep of the entire 172.16.0.0 subnet and got hits in every subnet (so we found cameras in 172.16.1.0, 172.16.2.0, 172.16.3.0, etc…) so it would only make sense that each of those subnets had another school’s security cameras in them and their password was in the form “mcps_” plus the school code. Instead of trying to find every school’s school code, we just tried every password combination (that is we tried mcps_1, mcps_2, mcps_3, …, mcps_999). We automated this of course so we got it done in a matter of seconds so it was no big deal. So at this point we had access to every single camera in the entire county :D</p><p>- ## No internet for you!</p><p>- I had so much fun doing that.</p><p>- Once competitions started, they were really fun competitions, but none of them really hit like the adrenaline that you got when you figured out how to hack the next thing in real life. With competitions, breaking out of the box is fun, but the stakes just aren't that high.</p><p>- High school "content filtering", is more like "child surveillance" now that more powerful internet filters are available, the ethics of which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://elestoque.org/2022/10/07/uncategorized/deconstructing-securly/">are questionable</a>. There is so much of the Internet that you can't access and tools that you can use, it is insane. I recently spent a lot of time running into problems with this.</p><p>- ### It is like NCIS, but for kids</p><p>- I have run a cyber security competition recently where 200 students tried to forensically investigate a fictional murder mystery, whose evidence was on the internet. If you are interested in more details, here is a video about it:</p><p>- {{video https://youtu.be/2AOxuHuHS1U?t=27}}</p><p>- It is so much fun to run this. We just had our 7th year running this, and each year it has become easier because I have been writing a better <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/ctfg/ctfg">service to host it</a>. Over the years, I have had high schoolers who competed end up helping me so the competition grew better and better every year. By hosting it at the local community college, we bring 200 students every year into a building that they could end up going to, and cemented in their minds as a place where they care about cyber security.</p><p>- We ended up spending a ton of time trying to set the competition up in a way where the _very_ locked down systems that the students had were capable of accessing the competition site, and be able to solve the challenges. Given that this is a very real world competition, there are tools that the students need to use, but the computers are simply Chromebooks with very restrictive networks. When the competition started, our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://wiki.ctfg.io/">wiki page</a> was not able to be accessed, the firewall was blocking it. Without access to this page, most students would not be able to progress. Anticipating that there would be problems like this, we built an entire virtual system that the students could use to access everything that they needed. It was really, really annoying to deal with.</p><p>- ## Show some respect, the kids are hacking</p><p>- If I was going to school right now, I would hack the living _shit_ out of these computers. We used to install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)">Halo</a> on every computer in a classroom so that we could have a LAN party and play with everyone.</p><p>- Rodney Mullen, a world renown skateboarder, gave a TED talk on how <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neOybMdWZbU">skateboarding was similar to hacking</a>. Skateboarding and hacking require a great deal of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>. An insane amount of focus is needed to "do what you were not supposed to". Have you ever considered how the fuck the physics works on the shit people do when riding a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnLoCkFdyvY">_rail_</a>? Oh yeah, and kids are doing this. Every day, skateboarders invest their time, and literally their body, to honing in an intricate physics equations they can come up with in their head. If you don't believe me that skateboarding is important, it is literally in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://olympics.com/en/sports/skateboarding/">olympics</a>.</p><p>- Hacking is not just getting into unauthorized places like the movies will have you think, it is about doing something to show that you can do something crazy! You want to give someone that "holy shit, you just did that?" moment. I used to bring my own computer every day just so I didn't have have to deal with any restrictions from the school's computers. It was the only way that I could stay in my flow of hacking. If I had to deal with the insane restrictions on the school computers, I would actually just spend every second of my day thinking about how to bypass the ludicrous restrictions, and you aren't going to stop me.</p><p>- ## Be realistic</p><p>- If you impose crazy restrictions, you are going to make some insane hackers that you can't control. It is really that simple. What if I, as a professional security researcher, happen to end up doing some research about the very same security system you are using. I might post an anonymous post somewhere on the internet and a student ends up finding it. Very much in the same way that I learned how to hack the cameras.</p><p>- It really isn't that hard, give students the tools that they need to play and they will be happy. My high school teacher literally manages his own server racks so that he can let his cyber class hack something. He wheels a massive server rack around his classroom because that is the best that he can do. Incredible! Help this man out! He is trying to teach cyber security! You need resources for that, damn.</p><p>- If anyone who is a teacher, student, someone in charge of a school system reads this and wants to talk more about how to actually teach cyber security, I can help you. Don't make the same mistake NYU did: [[NYU Dropped the Ball]]. Hit me up on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/breadchris">twitter</a>.</p>

	- <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="hA1siXMbDiU">youtube</a></p><p>Folding 1000 origami cranes sounds at lot easier than it is. When my engineer mind latched onto the idea of completing this task, I was intrigued by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_thousand_origami_cranes">foretold wish</a> one would get in exchange for folding a bunch of the easiest origami models. Kids do this every year in Japan, how hard could it be? - On average, it would take me 5 minutes to fold a crane from start to finish. If you want to do that in a year, 1000 / 365 ~= 2.74. So if you assume you need to fold 3 a day, that is 15 minutes out of your day, every day, for a year where you are folding an origami crane. That is pretty straight forward. There are countless meetings or times when I could be on a call where I could pause, grab a piece of paper and knock one out. But the thing is, that 5 minutes is 5 minutes of pure focus. - In the age of automation, people have not been able to make a reliable origami folding machine, and there is a good reason. The dexterity that you need to be able to make something as "simple" as a crane, is actually quite impressive. Knowing how much delicate force to apply on the right place. Knowing to crease with your finger nail for a hard, definitive fold or your finger tip for a "non-committal" fold. (There is a cool video of someone using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9Bjs99A0k0">surgical robot arms to fold one</a>, but there is a still a human on the other end). Very quickly, you realize that a folding a crane is not a trivial task. Even if you wanted to rush it to make a "shitty" looking crane, that is still going to take time, and even more, with imprecise folds, you quickly find yourself unable to perform the next step. See, the folds in origami are deeply mathematical in nature. The paper is a finite, two dimensional plane and you are transforming the plane into irrational space. Being patient with every fold, and being careful of how folds are folded is very important for ending up with a well folded crane. - I decided to start folding after I went through a tough breakup at the beginning of January 2020. Over the course of the first year, I managed to only fold 800 of the 1000 I set out to make. It took me an additional 2 years to finish the last 200, so no wish lol. Every single one of those cranes captured a part of my day when I might have been bored and wanted something to do, a meeting where I needed something to do with my hands, a time where I felt sad about something and being able to bring myself to fold a crane was the little victory I needed. There were times when I would "rage fold", something around me was making me upset so I channeled all my anger into cranking out cranes. I think my rage folding record was like 15? - You also realize something about the reason about the origin of this tradition. Every year, people fold and bring <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2015/08/28/how-paper-cranes-became-a-symbol-of-healing-in-japan/">1000 cranes to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. There is something deeply intimate about offering something that you spent at least 83 hours of your year doing. Every crane is a chance to meditate on what is happening around you. A time to accept yourself for what you have been capable of. A time to consider what you could be working on after you are done folding. Man, I would get terribly distracted when folding. I would often take a piece of paper, thinking I was going to fold it and then a few days later I would look at it and go "oh, right". But the thing is, it was ok. Why wouldn't it be? If I wanted my wish, I was going to have to work for it. - You truly have to be in a state of flow in order to get your wish. I am hesitant to say that this experience has "profoundly" changed me, but I can certainly say that this has reinforced what it means to have "small wins" every day, and the compounding effect that they can have. Someone told me that the reason the US Military is so strict on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzLzbd-zT4">making your bed neatly every day</a> is to serve as a simple task that you can look back on and be proud of yourself that you have achieved. I find it very fitting that I made my bed before I started counting my cranes to see if I had gotten to 1000. - If you have never heard of this before, or maybe have and have been curious, I highly encourage you to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://a.co/d/2Cbrikh">buy some origami paper</a> (you don't need to buy 1000, you can start with much less) and try to make just one crane. If you haven't folded on before, I guarantee that there will be some struggle, but push through! My love, Erin, who is an artist, had a rough first attempt, but got it right on the next few. Let you work surprise you. I am not recommending that everyone try to fold 1000 cranes, I think that task is too daunting. Instead, just have some origami paper laying around (or even grabbing some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMXzRBDFpGU)">printer paper and turning it into a square</a>, play with it when you are bored. Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VqF8WGuBLA">this youtuber</a>, I have been following them forever, and they are some of the best origami videos out there. Learn/try to teach with your partner, your kids, your friends, your family. Learning to fold a crane is something that is very subtly impressive and incredibly rewarding, in my opinion of course. I hope I was able to inspire you to try something new today!</p>

	- <p>## SOLID principles</p><p>The set of five design principles for object-oriented programming that were first introduced by Robert C. Martin. These principles are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.</p><p></p><p>In Go, the SOLID principles can be applied as follows:</p><p>### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</p><p>Example:</p><p>	    </p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  type UserService struct {</p><p>	    userRepository UserRepository</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  </p><p>	  func (us *UserService) CreateUser(user *User) error {</p><p>	    return us.userRepository.Create(user)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  </p><p>	  func (us *UserService) GetUserByID(id int) (*User, error) {</p><p>	    return us.userRepository.GetById(id)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	    </p><p>	  In this example, the `UserService` has a single responsibility - to manage user-related operations. It does not have any knowledge of the underlying storage mechanism for the user data - this is delegated to the `UserRepository` interface.  </p><p>	- ### Open/Closed Principle</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  type Shape interface {</p><p>	  Area() float64</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Rectangle struct {</p><p>	  Width  float64</p><p>	  Height float64</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (r *Rectangle) Area() float64 {</p><p>	  return r.Width * r.Height</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Circle struct {</p><p>	  Radius float64</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (c *Circle) Area() float64 {</p><p>	  return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- In this example, we define a `Shape` interface that defines an `Area()` method. The `Rectangle` and `Circle` structs both implement this interface, and provide their own implementation of the `Area()` method. Now, if we want to add a new shape, we can simply create a new struct that implements the `Shape` interface without having to modify the existing code.</p><p>	- ### Liskov Substitution Principle</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  type Animal struct{}</p><p>	  - func (a *Animal) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Animal sound"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Dog struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (d *Dog) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Woof!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Cat struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (c *Cat) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Meow!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- In this example, the `Dog` and `Cat` structs inherit from the `Animal` struct. However, they each provide their own implementation of the `Speak()` method. By adhering to the LSP, we should be able to use an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` wherever we would have used an instance of `Animal` without modifying the behavior of the program.</p><p>	- ### Interface Segregation Principle</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	  type Animal struct{}</p><p>	  - func (a *Animal) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Animal sound"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Dog struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (d *Dog) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Woof!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Cat struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (c *Cat) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Meow!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- In this example, the `Dog` and `Cat` structs inherit from the `Animal` struct. However, they each provide their own implementation of the `Speak()` method. By adhering to the LSP, we should be able to use an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` wherever we would have used an instance of `Animal` without modifying the behavior of the program.</p><p>	- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  type UserRepository interface {</p><p>	  Create(user *User) error</p><p>	  GetById(id int) (*User, error)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type PasswordRepository interface {</p><p>	  CreateHash(password string) (string, error)</p><p>	  ValidatePassword(hash, password string) error</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	  In this example, we have two distinct interfaces - `UserRepository` and `PasswordRepository`. Each interface is specific to a particular responsibility - one for managing user-related operations, and one for managing password-related operations. This is preferable to having a single, monolithic interface that attempts to cover both responsibilities.  </p><p>	- ### Dependency Inversion Principle</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	  type Animal struct{}</p><p>	  - func (a *Animal) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Animal sound"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Dog struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (d *Dog) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Woof!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type Cat struct {</p><p>	  Animal</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - func (c *Cat) Speak() string {</p><p>	  return "Meow!"</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- In this example, the `Dog` and `Cat` structs inherit from the `Animal` struct. However, they each provide their own implementation of the `Speak()` method. By adhering to the LSP, we should be able to use an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` wherever we would have used an instance of `Animal` without modifying the behavior of the program.</p><p>	- ### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):</p><p>	- Example:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  type UserRepository interface {</p><p>	  Create(user *User) error</p><p>	  GetById(id int) (*User, error)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - type PasswordRepository interface {</p><p>	  CreateHash(password string) (string, error)</p><p>	  ValidatePassword(hash, password string) error</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	  In this example, we have two distinct interfaces - `UserRepository` and `PasswordRepository`. Each interface is specific to a particular responsibility - one for managing user-related operations, and one for managing password-related operations. This is preferable to having a single, monolithic interface that attempts to cover both responsibilities.  </p><p>	- ### Full Example</p><p>	- Here is an example of a Go program that applies the SOLID principles:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  package main</p><p>	    import "fmt"</p><p>	    // Single Responsibility Principle:</p><p>	    // Each struct has only a single responsibility.</p><p>	    // User struct represents a user in the system.</p><p>	    type User struct {</p><p>	        ID        int</p><p>	        FirstName string</p><p>	        LastName  string</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - // UserService struct defines a service for managing users.</p><p>	    type UserService struct {</p><p>	        users []User</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // AddUser adds a new user to the service.</p><p>	    func (s *UserService) AddUser(u User) {</p><p>	        s.users = append(s.users, u)</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // GetUserByID returns the user with the given ID.</p><p>	    func (s *UserService) GetUserByID(id int) User {</p><p>	        for _, u := range s.users {</p><p>	            if u.ID == id {</p><p>	                return u</p><p>	            }</p><p>	        }</p><p>	        return User{}</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // Open/Closed Principle:</p><p>	    // The UserService is open for extension, but closed for modification.</p><p>	    // We can add new functionality by implementing new interfaces,</p><p>	    // rather than modifying the existing UserService.</p><p>	    // UserRepository defines the interface for a user repository.</p><p>	    type UserRepository interface {</p><p>	        SaveUser(u User) error</p><p>	        FindUserByID(id int) (User, error)</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - // UserRepositoryImpl is a concrete implementation of the UserRepository interface.</p><p>	    // It uses the UserService to store and retrieve users.</p><p>	    type UserRepositoryImpl struct {</p><p>	        userService *UserService</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // SaveUser saves a user to the repository.</p><p>	    func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	        r.userService.AddUser(u)</p><p>	        return nil</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // FindUserByID finds a user with the given ID in the repository.</p><p>	    func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) FindUserByID(id int) (User, error) {</p><p>	        return r.userService.GetUserByID(id), nil</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // Liskov Substitution Principle:</p><p>	    // The UserRepositoryImpl should be substitutable for the UserRepository interface.</p><p>	    // This means that we should be able to use either the interface or the concrete implementation</p><p>	    // without knowing which one we are using.</p><p>	    // UserController is a controller for managing users.</p><p>	    // It uses a UserRepository to store and retrieve users.</p><p>	    type UserController struct {</p><p>	        repository UserRepository</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - // NewUserController creates a new UserController.</p><p>	    func NewUserController(r UserRepository) *UserController {</p><p>	        return &amp;UserController{repository: r}</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // CreateUser creates a new user.</p><p>	    func (c *UserController) CreateUser(u User) error {</p><p>	        return c.repository.SaveUser(u)</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    // GetUserByID gets the user with the given ID.</p><p>	    func (c *UserController) GetUserByID(id int) (User, error) {</p><p>	        return c.repository.FindUserByID(id)</p><p>	    }</p><p>	    func main() {</p><p>	        // Dependency Inversion Principle:</p><p>	        // The UserController depends on the UserRepository interface,</p><p>	        // rather than on the concrete UserRepositoryImpl.</p><p>	        // This allows us to use any implementation of the UserRepository interface with the UserController.</p><p>	        </p><p>	        userService := &amp;UserService{}</p><p>	        repository := &amp;UserRepositoryImpl{userService: userService}</p><p>	        controller := NewUserController(repository)</p><p>	        user := User{ID: 1, FirstName: "John", LastName: "Doe"}</p><p>	        controller.CreateUser(user)</p><p>	        retrievedUser, _ := controller.GetUserByID(1)</p><p>	        fmt.Println(retrievedUser)</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- In this example, the&nbsp;`User`&nbsp;struct represents a user in the system and has only the data and methods that are related to a user. The&nbsp;`UserService`&nbsp;struct defines a service for managing users, and follows the Single Responsibility Principle by having only a single responsibility (managing users).</p><p>	- The&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;interface and the&nbsp;`UserRepositoryImpl`&nbsp;struct demonstrate the Open/Closed Principle by defining an interface that can be implemented by different types, rather than modifying the existing&nbsp;`UserService`. The&nbsp;`UserRepositoryImpl`&nbsp;also satisfies the Liskov Substitution Principle by being substitutable for the&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;interface.</p><p>	- Finally, the&nbsp;`UserController`&nbsp;struct applies the Dependency Inversion Principle by depending on the&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;interface, rather than on a specific implementation of the interface. This allows us to use any implementation of the&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;interface with the&nbsp;`UserController`. For example, a memory implementation of&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;could be used in unit tests and a real database implementation of&nbsp;`UserRepository`&nbsp;could be used in integration tests using test containers.</p><p>	- To summarize, the SOLID principles are a set of design principles for object-oriented programming that can help to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. In Go, these principles can be applied by using structs, interfaces, and other language features to create modular, decoupled code that is easy to understand and extend.</p><p>	- Personally, following these principles have helped me to maintain a well tested, 50k+ line solo project.</p><p>	- Hope this was a useful read!</p><p>	- ## Questions</p><p>	-</p><p>	  &gt; Does this still fulfill SOLID, if&nbsp;`UserService`&nbsp;is removed (by moving the&nbsp;`UserService`&nbsp;logic to&nbsp;`UserRepository`)?  </p><p>	- In this specific example it wouldn't explicitly violate any principles, but if you were using a real database you'd want to abstract the database queries away so that data access implementation details don't leak into your business logic.</p><p>	- To illustrate using the example above, let's remove the&nbsp;`UserService`&nbsp;logic and move it to&nbsp;`UserRepositoryImpl`:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  var ErrUserNotFound = errors.New("user was not found")</p><p>	  - // Open/Closed Principle:</p><p>	  // The UserService is open for extension, but closed for modification.</p><p>	  // We can add new functionality by implementing new interfaces,</p><p>	  // rather than modifying the existing UserService.</p><p>	  // UserRepository defines the interface for a user repository.</p><p>	  type UserRepository interface {</p><p>	    SaveUser(u User) error</p><p>	    FindUserByID(id int) (User, error)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - // UserRepositoryImpl is a concrete implementation of the UserRepository interface.</p><p>	  // It uses an explicit users slice</p><p>	  type UserRepositoryImpl struct {</p><p>	    users []User</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  // SaveUser saves a user to the repository.</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    s.users = append(s.users, u)</p><p>	    return nil</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  // FindUserByID finds a user with the given ID in the repository.</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) FindUserByID(id int) (User, error) {</p><p>	    for _, u := range s.users {</p><p>	        if u.ID == id {</p><p>	            return u, nil</p><p>	        }</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - return User{}, ErrUserNotFound</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- This looks fine, functionality stays the same and we removed 17 lines of code, but let's add a few things.</p><p>	- What if we want to check if a user exists before saving it? We can do so with the following:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  // SaveUser saves a user to the repository.</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    for _, user := range s.users {</p><p>	        if u.ID == user.ID {</p><p>	            return ErrUserWithIDExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - s.users = append(s.users, u)</p><p>	    return nil</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- As our user base grows, maybe we want to add a unique&nbsp;`username`&nbsp;field to the&nbsp;`User`. We can add the field to the&nbsp;`User`&nbsp;struct and on save check if the username is unique and doesn't contain any bad words.</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  var ErrUsernameExists = errors.New("user with username already exists")</p><p>	  - type User struct {</p><p>	    ID        int</p><p>	    FirstName string</p><p>	    LastName  string</p><p>	    Username string</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  - // SaveUser saves a user to the repository.</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    if badWords.Contains(u.Username) {</p><p>	        return ErrUsernameInvalid</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - for _, user := range s.users {</p><p>	        if u.ID == user.ID {</p><p>	            return ErrUserWithIDExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	  - if u.Username == user.Username {</p><p>	            return ErrUsernameExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - s.users = append(s.users, u)</p><p>	  - return nil</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- Now if we wanted to rewrite SaveUser using an actual database:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  // SaveUser saves a user to the repository.</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    if badWords.Contains(u.Username) {</p><p>	        return ErrUsernameInvalid</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - users := r.db.Query("select * from users").ScanStructs(User{})</p><p>	    for _, user := range users {</p><p>	        if u.ID == user.ID {</p><p>	            return ErrUserWithIDExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	  - if u.Username == user.Username {</p><p>	            return ErrUsernameExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - return r.db.Exec("insert into users(id, first_name, last_name, username) values (?, ?, ?, ?)", u.ID, u.FirstName, u.LastName, u.Username)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- Still maintainable but it could look something like this which I personally find more readable:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    if badWords.Contains(u.Username) {</p><p>	        return ErrUsernameInvalid</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - users := r.repository.QueryAllUsers()</p><p>	    for _, user := range users {</p><p>	        if u.ID == user.ID {</p><p>	            return ErrUserWithIDExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	  - if u.Username == user.Username {</p><p>	            return ErrUsernameExists</p><p>	        }</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - return r.repository.SaveUser(u)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- You could refactor even further:</p><p>	-</p><p>	  ```go</p><p>	  func (r *UserRepositoryImpl) SaveUser(u User) error {</p><p>	    err := r.repository.ValidateUser(u);</p><p>	    if err != nil {</p><p>	        return err</p><p>	    }</p><p>	  - return r.repository.SaveUser(u)</p><p>	  }</p><p>	  ```</p><p>	- Now it's even more clear what the code does: validate the input then save. By abstracting the implementation away from the intention, you can read more immediately know what SaveUser is supposed to do. And when you want to know how user validation or saving the user actually works, you can navigate to the definition at that point.</p><p></p>

- Why you aren't using gRPC | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 9th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]], [[grpc]]
	- <p>From the first moment I saw it, I thought that gRPC was going to change how people transferred data on the Internet. What are we using? Untyped JSON to REST endpoint? Obviously asking for problems. JSON schema? Better, but I don't want to write that crap. Also tooling is annoying. GraphQL? Pretty nice. Better than gRPC when dealing with many related objects, but again tooling is eh. gRPC is built on Protobuf, a simple type system that has been battle-hardened by Google and other large companies over the past 20 years. But you don't really see gRPC used outside of such large, mostly tech, companies. Why is that?</p><p>Well I think t</p><p>1. Learning Curve: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, a language-agnostic data serialization format, and requires developers to understand the concepts and protocols associated with it. The learning curve involved in understanding gRPC's concepts and usage patterns may deter some developers.</p><p></p><p>2. Existing Infrastructure: Many organizations have established infrastructure and APIs built on traditional RESTful architectures, making it challenging to transition to gRPC without significant effort and changes to their existing systems.</p><p></p><p>3. Compatibility: gRPC uses HTTP/2 as the underlying protocol, which is not supported by all network infrastructure and proxy servers. This lack of compatibility may limit the adoption of gRPC in certain environments.</p><p></p><p>4. Language Support: While gRPC supports multiple programming languages, the ecosystem and community support may not be as extensive as that of more established technologies, such as RESTful APIs.</p><p></p><p>5. Use Cases: gRPC is best suited for scenarios requiring high-performance, low-latency, and bidirectional streaming capabilities. It may not be the ideal choice for all types of applications and use cases, especially those that prioritize simplicity and convention over performance optimizations.</p><p></p><p>6. Mindset and Familiarity: Developers, architects, and organizations often have established patterns, frameworks, and tools they are familiar with. The shift to gRPC may require a change in mindset and tooling, which can be a barrier to adoption.</p><p></p><p>7. Documentation and Resources: The availability and quality of documentation, tutorials, and sample projects can play a crucial role in encouraging adoption. If the learning resources and community support for gRPC are limited, it may hinder widespread adoption.</p>

- Massive Redesign | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 7th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]]
	- <p>Well I have gone down the rabbit hole today on changing the way that everything looks. There are still some blemishes, but there is much more space for writing content. Oh, and I also added an AI feature where if you highlight the text then it will ask you if you want to use that as a prompt and the output will be streamed into the editor. I am super stoked with the progress that I have made here. But then again, I still failed to add the feature that would have made this a more engaging post; image uploads. I have an idea of how I want to achieve this, but in my haphazard design process, it doesn't come to mind until I need it (ex. now). How does this happen?</p><p></p><p>Well, I am usually super stoned when I am coding and things that catch my attention are the things directly in front of me. Since I was not typing out a post until now, the image upload wasn't remotely relevant to me. But now that I am writing the post, the lack of the feature is quite painful. Letting myself feel the pain of the absent feature is very important for design. It gives you the perspective of your user. They don't have the code, they most likely don't want to. What would they do if they couldn't upload images? Much less than I could. While I am still overall really happy with what I did today, I am not shying away from the disappointment of not being able to have an image in this update. Yes I could use imgur or something else, but I want to use this feeling to make me want to code the thing.</p>

- The feeling to perform | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 6th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]]
	- <p>I had some interviews today. In the first one, I was asked a question to which I knew the answer, but the words weren't quite there. I felt myself looping on, thinking of the answer, and then being frustrated. Time passed, and I couldn't put my thoughts into words. Somewhere deep in my knowledge I knew how to respond, but in the moment I couldn't answer. Overall, the interviews went fine. If I were hiring me, I would be a strong candidate overall. But this one interview got to me. Why couldn't I answer?</p><p></p><p>Knowing is different than doing. Doing is a performance where you communicate/demonstrate what you know. I had to perform in the interview so that the other person could assess what I learned. Historically, this has been a source of great stress for me and is the source of stress for probably most humans on planet Earth. I am not sure exactly what the cause of this loop is, but I have to imagine taking innumerable tests in school did not help. Day in and day out, students are assessed on how well they can comprehend what was being discussed in class. If you want to "do well," you _must_ perform, and failing to means a lower grade.</p><p></p><p>In high school, it started to occur to me that it was illogical to stress before a test. Instead of trying to cram before tests, I adopted the mindset of just going with it. Suppose I didn't know the information; reading through the book 5 minutes before the test wouldn't help me. If I got a bad grade, so be it. Understanding this was life-changing because it was one less thing that I had to spend the week/month leading up to the test worrying about. I started to emphasize reading and understanding what was assigned to me more and gave less of a fuck about the tests, and it worked for me.</p><p></p><p>I got lucky to have gone to the school that I did. I had a few less-than-favorable classes where I would have no problem cheating (bad vibes bring bad vibes), but most were great. Being able to separate the tests from learning and understanding made everything better. I didn't have exceptional grades, but I didn't have bad ones; I was simply happy with my ability to learn.</p><p></p><p>All of this is to say that when it comes to performing, turn your brain off. Trust in your ability to perform; if you get bad vibes about your performance, use that to fuel your next attempt. Work the hours, learn more, and be driven by your passion. Performances are grounding and give you a pleasantly sharp pang of reality; use it to your advantage.</p>

- I wrote some elm today! | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 5th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]]
	- <p>I had a friend take me on a journey through elm today while on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-5g40grOpk">stream</a> today. The exercises they gave me were really well thought out and it was a lot of fun to feel how the code evolved between each <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://conversationengine.ddns.net/elm-intro/">task</a>. Starting from a simple counter, it built up to where you were managing a list of list of counters. The cycle of building the thing that just works, and then refactoring it so it could take on more abstraction illustrated why elm's architecture shines. Helpful compiler hints as you incrementally introduce changes to your code makes the thorough type system manageable. Even without a full IDE, the online editor <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://ellie-app.com">ellie</a> has enough tooling to get you started with building basic apps. The auto-formatter is a little unwieldy as it tries to interpret what you are trying to format your code like vs adhering to a strict format. Building something somewhat involved was a great mental exercise and is encouraging to build more with elm in the future :)</p>

- I am coming for you transcription editor | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 3th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]]
	- <p>A common theme in high thinkies is that I want to record my thoughts in a way that doesn't get in my way of my thoughts. For example, writing down notes has been historically difficult and when the thinkies are coming in at blistering speed, it is difficult to keep up. So I started to just talk and record what I said. Audio files are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/c3f3cba6-2398-4440-96b3-b02c9856ff00">super small</a>. I also started <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/@breadchris/streams">streaming</a> to also document what I was working on. All of this came about because I was learning how to say "fuck it" to being a perfectionist and started to just stream my consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The problem is, this content is pretty opaque. In order to gain insights into what I was talking about, I would need to listen back to many days of audio and video at this point. So to solve this, I integrated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whisper.cpp&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">whisper.cpp</a> into this platform so I can drag and drop files and get a transcription. Great, now I get to _read_ days of audio and video. AI summary of the transcript? Kind of helpful, but still missing something.</p><p></p><p>There is a tool out there that does what I want, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>. If you haven't seen it, it is pretty incredible. You do what I just did of getting a transcription for your audio/video, but when you edit the transcript, it also edits the video. The feature that really blew me away was the "remove um's and ah's", and it really does work. This is what is missing from my app. I have thought about this feature for so long. I have had ChatGPT write me the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e86721e2-7f32-49b0-9323-7ad49ff49533">function</a> I need for it.</p><p></p><p>The blog editor is in an OK state. I still need to get image upload working, I have some ideas. The transcription editor would be so freaking cool. I need to have it.</p>

- What language am I looking for? | 
  created-at:: [[Feb 1th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[thinkies]]
	- <p>If you ask anyone who knows me what my thoughts are on javascript, you will get a unanimous "he hates it". Typescript helps, but it doesn't fix the problems. I don't believe the problems I have with it are actually solvable without some radical changes in the ecosystem. Why do I care so much? Because I freaking want to build websites that stick around for a while goddamnit! Sites built with the "right decisions" today feel like they fall over from a strong breeze. I hate to admit it, but in 2024, the right way to build a website is probably a Typescript and React app. I have pushed hard against these choices, but the network effects are just too strong. There is just too much mindshare, packages, integrations, documentation that exists to justify using other technology for the frontend. When I first learned about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> I grew optimistic. Their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hypermedia.systems/">book</a> talks about what was theorized from early days on the Internet and the lost art of hypermedia driven design. If you are building a discrete system (ex. contracting, small company, etc.), htmx is the correct choice. It is just so dead simple to use. There might be a bit of a learning curve, but more and more people are using it within existing web frameworks, like django, documentation on how to solve problems will exist. Unfortunately, htmx does not pass the test of a technology that scales with the size of your team/company. There is little that binds the htmx API endpoints you put in the html to the backend which implements the logic. Maybe this could be solved in time with tooling, but there is also the problem with managing more complicated state, the DOM is just a difficult place for it. And then there was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://elm-lang.org/">elm</a>. </p><p></p><p>Elm is my mistress, its beauty intoxicating. The type system is reminiscent of Haskell, meaning runtime errors are almost non-existent. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">architecture</a> is meant to directly support building components and managing the state as your codebase increases in size. I was surprised to see just how many <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://package.elm-lang.org/">packages</a> people have built. Then again, when a language is written well, it is easy to build packages. The most important part of Elm, imo, is that it compiles to javascript and has strong support for interop between it with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/ports">ports</a>. It is not a naive project that is trying to force you into its language, you can incrementally add it to your app. This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFrKffrKCeU">talk</a> on elm was enlightening.</p><p></p><p>Why not go full elm? It is not at a major version release. There were some breaking changes from 0.18 to 0.19 that while well documented is indicative of the state of the project. The language is taking its time to be written well, which I do not fault, but makes it hard to justify using it. I could incrementally adopt it, but then that would be another language someone using my project would have to learn. I am using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://connectrpc.com/">connect rpc</a> which compiles grpc to js, I would need to write some elm ports to hook those up or port the transport to elm. Not impossible, just work.</p><p></p><p>When do you take a risk on a language? When you are dealing with such low stakes with coding, as is often the case with a personal project, why wouldn't you take these risks? I have rewritten many projects in my pursuit of finding a stack that "feels right". Is elm a part of it?</p>

- SF Feels like another Planet | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 31th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[hacktheplanet]], [[thinkies]]
	- <p>I am visiting SF right now, and almost every billboard in the city has "AI" on it. I need to build image upload so that I can show you what I am talking about. I get it, there is a lot of hype for companies to cash in on, so why wouldn't you?</p><p></p><p>AI (ML or machine learning for the pedantic) is super cool and can do a lot of things now. It will only continue to improve over time, but probably a little too fast for comfort. There is a ton of personal data that is going to be pushed through the ML training meat grinder. Insane capabilities of models are right around the corner, but who is going to benefit from them? The jury is still out on data privacy and how to relate ML. Those in power barely understand social media let alone our recent advancements towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL</a>.</p><p></p><p>I have a unique position of being able to help secure how data is handled as it relates to training ML models and I find it paramount to make sure it is done right. Shortcuts for building ML should not be tolerated, however I fear this is the beginning of many greedy attempts to do just that.</p><p></p><p>People deserve to own their data, first and foremost. We need more policy like GDPR to make sure that is the case. In the meantime, I want to build tools to empower people to collecting and use the data that they have. There is much to be explored here. #hacktheplanet</p>

- Offline-First Editing | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 30th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[100daystooffload]]
	- <p>I like to check in, every so often, on the state of offline-first solutions. Most of what exists is focused around sqlite. Here are some of the projects that pop up frequently when I search:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite">cr-sqlite</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/mycelial/mycelite?tab=readme-ov-file">mycelite</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/sqlite-sync/SQLite-sync.com">sqlite-sync</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://litesync.io/en/">litesync</a> (not open source)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync">sqlsync</a></p></li></ul><p></p><p>The appeal of an offline-first experience is pretty well summed up by cr-sqlite's tag line: "It's like Git, for your data." We are constantly generating data, and in many different ways. We might be typing into an input box or we might be talking to a friend. Entering numbers into a spreadsheet or creating a top-secret blueprint for a weapon of mass destruction. At the end of the day it is data. Being able to seamlessly move this data around into different contexts depending on where we would like it to be is a pervasive desire that we have. I built the list above from my browsing history. My browsing history is local to my computer, but I wanted this blog post to be published to the web. Different contexts. Lol, it almost feels like we want to collaborate with our past selves and the data that we created. The better the tools that exist to quickly grab an artifact of the past and compose it together with our ideas in the moment, the more interesting content we can create.</p><p></p><p>I don't think the state of offline-first tooling is quite there yet, it is still quite new. We are getting there though. I look forward to running some experiments :)</p>

- Workflow Engine syntax isn't making me happy, halp | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 25th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[100daystooffload]]
	- <p>I have been building a workflow engine that can route strongly-typed data through durable functions (guaranteed to execute). These functions do not need to exist in the process, they could be remote APIs, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://grpc.io/">grpc</a> servers, a p2p connection with your friend's computer. It supports streaming of data with observables, thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo">rxgo</a>, meaning you can create rules to map, filter, reduce data without redeployment.</p><p>This is the sketch I have in my head, and have been trying to implement it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/protoflow-labs/protoflow/tree/main">here</a>. Something that I am trying to nail is the syntax for how to express these workflows. You can take a look at what I have so far in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/protoflow-labs/protoflow/blob/main/pkg/workflow/workflow_test.go#L14">simple test</a> I wrote ([graph]( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNp10D1rwzAQBuC_ctycDHY3D51KoVDaUo9WBmEdiSj64HRKCUn-e2VZpkurQRLvI8HLXXEOhnDAI-t4gtdP5aEsnkbiM_EAQkmgO6yx76bn7GexwcNb-de437j_kx8aWx-zTC_LDqMwadcgZFnkvR7wwWGmlKw_Fm51YL9_vEUOZ2so3UqPf_J-61nB6ZhAwm9eG1T6tkzNuq18BXJWVlhb4Q4dsdPWlCFdl6cK5USOFA7lajR_KVT-Xt7pLGG8-BkH4Uw7zNFooSery2zdGt5_AMgGeW0)">https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNp10D1rwzAQBuC\_ctycDHY3D51KoVDaUo9WBmEdiSj64HRKCUn-e2VZpkurQRLvI8HLXXEOhnDAI-t4gtdP5aEsnkbiM\_EAQkmgO6yx76bn7GexwcNb-de437j\_kx8aWx-zTC\_LDqMwadcgZFnkvR7wwWGmlKw\_Fm51YL9\_vEUOZ2so3UqPf\_J-61nB6ZhAwm9eG1T6tkzNuq18BXJWVlhb4Q4dsdPWlCFdl6cK5USOFA7lajR\_KVT-Xt7pLGG8-BkH4Uw7zNFooSery2zdGt5\_AMgGeW0</a> of what is going on).</p><p>I could use some people's eyes and brain to help me work through how to make this feel better to code.

- Why aren't there more personal sites? | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 15th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[100daystooffload]]
	- <p>It bothers me that more people don't have personal sites. In my opinion, we all do interesting things. In order to communicate the interesting things that we do, we need to provide others with an immersive experience of our world. Personal sites of designers and artists attempt to capture our imagination with an elegantly simple and refreshing display of their portfolios or wild 3d graphics. It makes sense why this isn't the norm, these sites take time. But people are willing to put in the time to build creative sites, as myspace and tumblr have shown. Yet, more restrictive social media sites, twitter, youtube, facebook, reign supreme.</p><p>I think there is a fine balance between sites that give you all the freedom in the world to create and sites that have some requirements. Maybe the solution is something that is more hybrid. You can have building blocks of content, a timeline of tweets, videos, etc. but the content is anything that you could dream of. Like a universal file uploader _and_ formatter. Themes would give people a starting point to express themselves, and a marketplace could emerge for people to build more visually interesting ones.</p><p>More thoughts to come on this :)</p>

- What is a good refactoring task? | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 20th, 2024]]

	- <p>There has been a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/lunabrain-ai/lunabrain/blob/54ddc68f80bf8d4a8978aa73f84f994b41bec410/js/site/form/ProtobufMessageForm.tsx">part of this code</a> that I have been wanting to refactor for a while. Patch on patch of this form has left this code in disarray. This code is actually quite important to this site as well. It is a general application form that leverages the power of Protobuf's expressive type system to generate a form a user can interact with. I have some ideas for where I want to take this code, but they haven't been a priority. The form worked well enough, until it didn't.</p><p>I went to use the form today to try to enter in some information and I encountered a problem. If a map was referenced in the form, it would not save properly due to how the data was being serialized and sent:</p><p>```</p><p>{ "key": "some key", "value": "some value" }</p><p>```</p><p>should have been</p><p>```</p><p>{ "some key": "some value" }</p><p>```</p><p>Because of how this code was written, there was not a strong separation of concerns, which was a concern. Since this is a bug that is stopping a critical flow through this app, I had to resolve it. There were 2 options: tack on another patch or rewrite it sanely. When I code, I have shifted over the years to favor the former. When you can afford to write a patch, it is usually faster to implement and you can keep things moving. Just make sure you leave notes along the way, future you will thank you. Additionally, writing a patch doesn't stop you from rewriting. It is possible that by going through the exercise of adding the patch, you are able to load enough of the code into your head to more efficiently rewrite the code.</p><p>I started with attempting a patch. I am currently the sole developer of this codebase and so far patches to this form have been able to get me by. Reading through the code to track down the problem, I realized just how deep the problem is rooted. To patch on a solution would be more of a dirty, dirty hack to get it working. I didn't even bother thinking all the way through how I would have gotten it working because of how complicated it seemed. The stars had aligned to give this code a proper rewrite.</p><p>I rewrote this code to be as functional and generic as possible so that it could be reused for different purposes. It has been a while since I have as proud as I was to write this function. I felt myself tapping into some distant knowledge I had on functional ocaml as I wrote this. The solution was elegant and exactly what I needed. Opting for the rewrite was not free, it took time. The trade of time for this code was well worth taking and future me will be very grateful.</p>

- what i have learned about the problem i want to solve |

	- <p>There are many things that I could be doing. I have spent a lot of time doing cyber security, I have spent a lot of time coding, maybe if I am lucky I could be a baker from all the time I have spent baking. But there is only so much time in the day. There are only so many things that you can get 10,000 hours of mastery over. And even if you have "mastered" it, have you felt good doing it? My attention wanders a lot during the day. "Why did those eggs stick the pan?"; "What if you didn't have to write code in Javascript?"; "Maybe I want to play some guitar now." It is hard to narrow in on what exactly I should do, let alone what I want to do. But, if you treat life like a game, you can start to come up with answers that are more "right" than others.</p><p>You are just gamifying your life. Your life goals are just the things in your video game that you are trying to achieve. Setting goals for yourself is quite tricky, especially at a time when there are so many goals that you could be setting. Maybe you want to do what your friend is doing, maybe you want to learn that thing you saw on Instagram, or maybe you will get into yoga this year. You can do a lot of things, but the choice is crippling. I think most people are paralyzed by the options and end up choosing none. There are no perfect life goals to set, they are different for everyone. I like to think of it as people just trying to figure out what their "art" is.</p><p>I wanted to get really good at bass because I thought that it would be cool to be good at some form of "art". My life didn't feel satisfying unless I had learned some type of "art". I was jealous of people I saw on Youtube who could lay down crazy bass licks, all the while feeling completely incapable of playing simple songs. But the jealously slowly turned into realization. These people have spent ungodly hours on this instrument to be able to play like that. Even if I had happened to have picked up this instrument when I was they did, what are the odds that I would still be playing today?</p><p>You don't just need time to practice, you need energy. You need intrinsic motivation that pushes you through the point where any normal person would stop, and then you continue to break through. To me, someone who practices that is an "artist" and it applies to anything. I think people think I am crazy when I say this but I tell them anyways "a janitor could be into the art of cleaning!" And why not? Maybe they janitor with such passion that it would make an Olympian look like they perform half-heartedly. Maybe the odds are low on that one, but hopefully you see my point. I started to rethink some things I thought about myself.</p><p>I though programming was too nerdy. I had spent a lot of my life being "too nerdy" meaning I answered questions in class or spent too long explaining things I was passionate about, I guess. And typical judgement on nerds is that they aren't valuable to be around, maybe their existence is so oppressive that you need to beat them up, who knows. This fear of judgement led me to always distance myself somewhat from coding. It was a means to an end. The job I would do to "become successful" by working 9 to 5 at a job that I will complain about every day, and realize there is no fixing the crippling problems of the company.</p><p>So I made programming my art. I decided it was the thing that I would spend an ungodly amount of time thinking about and doing.</p><p>I am so far down a rabbit hole, maybe this is somewhat coherent. If not, I am not sorry. It is your fault for reading until here without having stopped reading. Maybe you should have a better hobby than reading SHIT CONTENT. If you are still reading then you are definitely a masochist who HAS to finish what they are reading, no matter how bad this content becomes. I could start writing erotica and you would like it, wouldn't you. Jesus stop reading this. I know how to piss you</p>

	- <p>This post was written by a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/lunabrain-ai/lunabrain">tool</a> that I have been building for a while, and I think this is the first feature that is remotely helpful. I am writing this post in the browser and it is then going to get saved to the database. When I click the Publish button at the top of this page, then the post will be written to a file in LogSeq where I will push it to Github and link people to it from there. Now, this is so much more effort than writing a tweet, but the big difference here is that the content that I have written is saved to my computer first, so that I retain control of it. If I wanted to later access my tweet, I would have to use twitter. What if twitter is down? What if it goes away tomorrow? These are common questions people ask about online services, but little really exists as an answer. I don't want to build another social media site. I really just want to help people connect their ideas in a safe space before they publish them somewhere else. Maybe it does grow into something more social. I am going to continue to focus on solving small problems I have in my life with this app.</p>

	- <p>Idk what happened this morning but I went through my normal routine and then something just hit me which crippled my momentum. I have learned that listening to my body and trying to meet it where it is at in the moment vs trying to fight the feeling pays dividends over time. I try to map the feeling to a probability of what it is that I need. Often this feeling comes from not having enough water, so I drank some water and took a 20 minute nap. I went to my bed with the purpose to sleep and not to linger on my phone. Waking up from this nap felt amazing and the rest of my day started to look brighter in terms of me getting to do what I wanted to do. Everyone's body is different, but there are foundational needs that we have to meet if we want to keep our energy up. Check in with yourself when you are feeling off to try to figure out what need your body is trying to tell you.</p>

	- <p>So if my calculations are right, I should be able to do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Save this post with the tag #100daystooffload</p></li><li><p>Click publish above</p></li><li><p>Reload the site at /@breadchris</p></li><li><p>I should be able to see this post</p></li></ul><p>This flow is a solid step in the direction of where I want to take this tool. With a little bit of tweaking, I now have a way to publish my ideas to the Internet the way that I want to. I want them to go to my own freaking website! But damn if that isn't too much to ask. Install wordpress? ghost? Yuck, why is this software so bloated? This has been a painstaking process in trying to make the most light weight experience for publishing your ideas, and the personal site is just the beginning. Very soon I will have this content being published to twitter. I want to take my youtube live streams, edit them here, and then share those edits. Man, this is going to be so cool.</p>

- Hacking Culture | 
  created-at:: [[Jan 14th, 2024]]
  tags:: [[100daystooffload]]
	- <p>I had a call with a friend who was a hacker in the golden days of hacking. There were lots of exciting things happening in security as problems were unearthed, and solutions theorized. Over time, these problems that came up became solved. Buffers got compiler and runtime checks. SQL injection doesn't exist when you use prepared statements. XSS doesn't exist if you use React. The bread and butter of what hackers were poking at slowly shrunk as companies changed their development practices. This isn't to say that security is solved. You could argue that the world is more vulnerable than it has ever been, as a whole, because of the shear amount of technology that exists. The thing that has shifted security has been the "juicy targets" requiring more and more time to hack. Less people are trying to hack banks because there are actually a number of protections that exist. These checks don't stop someone from committing fraud, that is still super easy, but they stop attacks en masse. Commercializing security is antithetical to the core ethos of what it means to be a "hacker". Hackers challenge the status quo. They operate where the interface meets the implementation. They will understand things that no one in their right mind should understand. Driven by purpose and meaning a hacker finds and exposes what is possible. Their "exploits" provoke questions and our lives are changed as a result. I used to think hacking was exclusive to security, but I couldn't be any more wrong. There are so many hackers that exist in different disciplines.</p>

- Dogfooding |

	- <p>I think there are some really cool things that you get when you dogfood the thing you are building. For those who are unfamiliar with "dogfood", as it relates to the tech world, it means to use it yourself. I have not had much focus on the projects that I have been working on, and now that I am directly dogfooding the app, which aims to help me increase the frequency and quality of how I write, I am held accountable. If my app sucks, I will not want to use it, I will have to resort to another workflow for writing. If the app is good, then I have achieved my goal. I have tried many different workflows for writing over the years and none of them really quite "get me". I think something like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> has come the closest, but it is still not quite there. I want to write completely free of distractions, but when I want to connect my ideas with other people I want it to be effortless. I don't just want to blast people with my ideas, I want to have feedback so that I can improve my writing. And beyond just writing ideas, I want the tool to help me identify prior rabbit holes I have gone down and surface them again when they are relevant. Browsing history is rich with this information, yet it is rarely referred to. Is the information not useful? I don't think so. Someone probably found some helpful resources on "how to program" when they were looking, but they probably opened too many tabs and the window eventually closed, losing their journey.</p><p>I want to help people discover just how awesome their minds are. We are all so incredibly interesting, we just need a way to communicate how cool we are with others. It isn't easy to do, being a content creator is a full time job, but I think with some better tooling we can all start to share more of our ideas.</p>

- Connecting your body and your mind |

	- <p>If someone were to talk to me about connecting my body to my mind a decade ago, I would have thought they were full of it. Regularly practicing meditation and now yoga has really made me realize how stupid you must be not to build this connection with yourself. Humans all have this incredible biological computer sitting inside their head and if you treat it as just that, a computer, it can do cool things. But in order for the computer to run at optimal capacity, there are some conditions you have to meet. Our bodies are constantly sending signals to us asking us to drink water, eat food, go for a walk. Whether we listen is another story. The western world does not put much emphasis on the development of intuition, as opposed to the cultural values of the east.</p><p>Yoga is not just a practice of stretching and strengthening your muscles, it also gives you an opportunity to develop an intuition about what your body is telling you. Can you stretch in that direction? No? What if you breath into it, what does your body tell you now. I am consistently surprised with just how much I can push myself in yoga by just focusing on the simple act of being and connecting with my body.</p><p>Being aware of what your body is telling you branches into all aspects of your life. You are you after all. Knowing when work can wait so that you can take time for things that feel more worth your time so that your body will thank you later is indispensable.</p>
