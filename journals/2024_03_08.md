	- Understanding risk and mitigating it drives me. To understand risk, you must first understand the product. I excel at working with engineering teams to understand where security can seamlessly integrate within their workflows. Building tools and frameworks for making the easiest solution, the most secure one, is my passion. At Uber, I identified trends in bug bounty submissions, translated them into projects, and delivered tools and frameworks for mitigating the system issues in the infrastructure.
	- I have extensive experience with AWS and Kubernetes, having worked with them at both Uber and LunaSec. Due to their complex nature, they are prime candidates for security to introduce solutions for developers to use.
