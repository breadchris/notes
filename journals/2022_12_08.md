- e of has made me really interested in this area. being able to quickly find meaningful information given some provided context is incredibly powerful. nolan and i have been conceptualizing Protoflow https://breadchris.com/#/page/protoflow%2Fdemo where the aim is to make self contained blocks of code that are strictly typed with protobuf. you can have the wild west of code inside your block, but the types keep the blast radius small (dependency injection only, no global state). once you have isolated blocks, you can deploy them anywhere: lambda, kubes, ecs, etc. this system would let you transform any data you want and be able to reuse and share this data transformer effortlessly. turning an audio file from s3 into text is as simple as calling the “Download file from s3” and then “Audio file to Text block”. Just thought i would share some thoughts, connecting the dots of a lot of different ideas lol. trying to figure out how to build businesses too so i can fund these ideas, being in YC is really helpful to see how that works.
