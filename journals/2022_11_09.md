- security engineer thoughts
	- vulnerability management
	- DTCC
	- PCO
	- one go.mod
	- greenkeeping
	- "you can't update that, I use internal apis"
	- security engineer pillar, operates in security engineering
	- snyk
		- rescan doesn't rescan
		- "how many critical go vulns do we have?"
		- engineers might ignore too many
		- cli results are different than what are in github
		- finding is different than fixing
	- inbox zero vulnerability management
		- "I want to see important things in my inbox"
	- "I want to put security in the normal dev paths of where people are looking"
		- #lunasec #feature Use graphql api to create buttons that you can drop in arbitrary places (generate embed-able image, a build tag)
	- autofix is the dream
		- tests are insufficient for really proving a fix would work
	- monorepo is a whole other beast
	- "just fucking fix it"
	- patch hygiene
	- not convinced that 3rd party vulns are a problem, can red team prove this threat vector out?
		- higher confidence in findings would show a security engineer how they would exploit this themselves
