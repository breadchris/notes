- When is code fun?
	- When you get to see something happen
	- When you can take some data and make sense of it
	- When you can hand it to someone else and they can use it
- I want to help people have fun with code
	- I have taught at schools with scratch
	- I have seen how people code at Uber
	- I have some ideas about what it might look like
- What do I want to build?
	- Language
	- Framework
	- Developer tool

	- why was it so complicated?
	- > It used to be the case that you needed to train to become a scribe to write words for any reason. But just as pens were taken out of the hands of the scribe during the Reformation of Europe, we must take the code out of the hands of software engineers and share it with the masses. - jzhao
