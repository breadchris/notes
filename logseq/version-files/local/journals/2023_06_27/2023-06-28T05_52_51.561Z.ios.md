	- 5 Ws
	- develop company ideas
		- i have the hammer, what are the wood working projects
	- need to build tools to effectively work with protobuf types and build composable functions
		- should maybe read more about how type inferencing works?
	- data routing between nodes
		- when you have an output type from a parent node passing into the input of a child node, the types might not always have a 1 to 1 match, and the parent or child type might not be able to be modified. When this happens, the types must be adjusted to fit with each other.

		- ```protobuf
		  message ReadMessagesRequest {
		    string channelID = 1;
		    string lastMessageID = 2;
		  }
		  ```
		- and write message needs access to the channelID
		- when executing a workflow, the output data type of a block needs to be able to be paired with the input data type of another
	- lunabrain save and search is what I am building towards
		- save information from anywhere
		- search for information
		- slack bot that you can install
			- write updates to channels
