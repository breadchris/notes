- Data dog integration (https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/pull/716)
	- test to see if it works in production
- I have been getting the urge to ingest vulns using this project https://github.com/aquasecurity/vuln-list-update, but it is currently not prioritized work. It might be something that I do on the side over time.
