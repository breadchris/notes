		- > Roja chili is a type of chili pepper that is native to Mexico and is commonly used in Mexican cuisine. It is known for its moderate to hot heat level and its unique flavor, which has hints of fruitiness and a slight bitterness. The chili gets its name from the fact that it is often shaped like a small, red paw or claw. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/chat-gpt-185832ed5c8#41ff79cf-ab63-443e-aaf9-f78b67ce5a72)
