00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello, this is the second episode of High Thinkies.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,200
My thoughts coming at you as they're coming at me.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:28,640
So Alex and I were talking about cybersecurity-related things and what the hell were we thinking

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
about?

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,320
I forget what it was.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,240
But I said, okay, so I had this idea.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:45,880
So I just got finished watching this incredible video that I guess I'll leave in the text

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
below.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:56,800
But this video was talking about the history of VRChat and I did not know just how deep

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,480
VRChat went.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
It's absolutely incredible.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:14,440
People have programmed so much and the marketplace is so large.

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:25,240
I wonder if high schools have VR club and our kids are learning how to program and post

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:34,360
a fun VR and play the game in such a elaborate detail, but this video is so worth watching.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,280
It's incredible.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,560
And it had me think of building a VR world for CTF players or other types of hackers.

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,600
I don't know what it would look like, but because interacting in a virtual world isn't really

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
easy for programming.

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,800
But I don't know, maybe there's something clever, maybe you can make a matrix universe

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:08,440
and give people excited about it, excited about hacking.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:19,080
But yeah, anyway, it's high-thinkings for today.
