- How **you** can Build and Solve an NCIS-style, Cyber Forensics Murder Mystery
- What competitions do you know about?
- Do your students participate in any?
- How can games fit into and extend your curriculum?
	- a game does not _reliably_ teach concepts
	- it incentivizes learning
- Mongtgomery County Public Schools - High School Forensics (MCPSHSF)
	- https://mcpshsf.com
		- 2023 Walkthrough (Evidence map and 2-3 challenges)
		- flags and writeup to "stand in court"
		- analysis
		- communication
		- multiple choice _and_ free response
		- not just multiple choice
		- "Jeopardy" style
		- https://picoctf.com - Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
	- History of MCPSHSF
		- 10 years of competing in NYU-Poly CSAW High School Forensics
			- 50 to 100 participants in online - only 1 team to finals
			- Montgomery College needed a competition
			- Chris / NYU  --- MC - MCPS
			- High School Students started their Professional network then!
			- College Students -- built and scored through collaboration with professionals
			- Problem: Scaling!
			- Solution: xctf  - with the goal to double participation next year!

- Some history
	- security is still very new
	- ![catch-me.jpg](../assets/catch-me_1701124297453_0.jpg){:height 390, :width 262}
	- "hacking" has still only recently been accepted
	- ![210139.webp](../assets/210139_1701124113889_0.webp){:height 581, :width 273}
	- and so very few people really get this stuff
	- ![Coding da Vinci Kultur Hackathon.jpg](../assets/Coding_da_Vinci_Kultur_Hackathon_1701124502794_0.jpg)
	- but it is growing
	- ![Defcon Conference Las Vegas.webp](../assets/Defcon_Conference_Las_Vegas_1701124452224_0.webp){:height 347, :width 532}
	- and games are at the center
	- ![Capture the Flag Vis.jpg](../assets/Capture_the_Flag_Vis_1701124540584_0.jpg)
- How do you teach this stuff?
	- inherently hard to teach
	- ![Wargames Movie Poster.jpg](../assets/Wargames_Movie_Poster_1701124230393_0.jpg){:height 565, :width 357}
	- You can teach standards and protocols
	- ![Linux System Administration 1990.jpg](../assets/Linux_System_Administration_1990_1701123862218_0.jpg){:height 444, :width 307}
	- But technology changes rapidly
	- ![Capture-2023-11-27-142243.png](../assets/Capture-2023-11-27-142243_1701123776509_0.png){:height 396, :width 210}
	- And what do you focus on?
	- ![Security Mindmap.png](../assets/Security_Mindmap_1701123966048_0.png){:height 425, :width 562}
	- Historically you get certifications
	- ![Cyber Security Certifications.jpg](../assets/Cyber_Security_Certifications_1701124943115_0.jpg){:height 304, :width 525}
	- Colleges sparsely offer courses, and even less majors
	- TODO
	- Millions of jobs go unfilled each year
	- TODO
	- Technology continues to grow exponentially
	- ![Capture-2023-11-27-144758.png](../assets/Capture-2023-11-27-144758_1701125287235_0.png){:height 291, :width 534}
- What if instead of teaching, we played games?
	- ![Ender's Game.jpg](../assets/Ender's_Game_1701125479858_0.jpg){:height 434, :width 308}
	- Games teach in an imperfect way
	- You accept you will not learn everything
	- But you will learn _how_ to learn
	- Winning is the carrot on the stick to complete the game
- How do you play these games?
	- Attack and Defense
	- ![Attack defense ructf.png](../assets/Attack_defense_ructf_1701125998991_0.png)
	- Most realistic to how hacking is done in the real world
	- Difficult to setup and run
	- Most popular format is: "Jeapordy-style" CTF (Capture the Flag)
	- ![Capture the Flag Security.jpg](../assets/Capture_the_Flag_Security_1701125701575_0.jpg)
	- Exposes competitors to many different technologies
	- Requires "deep learning"
	- But it isn't perfect...
	- Can be overwhelming
	- Encourages "pattern matching"
	- Notable CTFs for high schools:
	- [picoctf](https://picoctf.org/) -> CMU
	- [tjctf](https://tjctf.org/) -> Thomas Jefferson High School
	- Going from question to answer is like taking a test,
	- What if these games were easy to run _and_ emulated the real world?
- We did this at NYU
	- For many years
	- ![CSAW Brooklyn Polytechnic.jpg](../assets/CSAW_Brooklyn_Polytechnic_1701124718490_0.jpg)
	- high schools from around the US would get flown to NYC
	- ![World's Largest Student Security Contest Names Top Cyber Sleuths, Hackers,  and Researchers | NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/cinema_large_default_1x/public/migrated/2015-11/pressrelease/CSAW-2015.jpg?h=7e756c91&itok=PtHSWiDS)
	- solve a murder mystery, with real world evidence
	- ![asdf.jpg](../assets/asdf_1701126784223_0.jpg){:height 366, :width 603}
	- Competitors were Cyber Security experts for a trial and would submit their findings report to the judge
	- ![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 3.16.40 PM.png](../assets/Screenshot_2023-11-27_at_3.16.40 PM_1701127020812_0.png){:height 468, :width 528}
	- Judged by real DHS and Secret Service agents
	- finalists would get scholarship money
	- ![Facebook Photo.jpg](../assets/Facebook_Photo_1701126886784_0.jpg){:height 380, :width 622}
	- competitors would become creators
	- helped build cyber security programs at high schools
	- And all of this was done by student volunteers
- We ran this at a community college
	- 7 years
	- 200+ students every year
	- Everyone looked forward to it every year
- And now we are bringing it to the internet
	- [xctf](http://xctf.io/)
