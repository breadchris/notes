      <description>I need groups! I want to give people links to questions to have them respond to it.
site is easier to build make it easier for someone to start their own site. condense the work needed for building one down. I think it would be nice to have a file tree menu that would map directly to paths on the site.</description>

      <title>Figuring out what to improve</title>

      <description>Sometimes, staring at something long enough is all it takes to figure out what to improve.
I moved from the TipTap editor to BlockNote, built on TipTap, but it comes with all the features I would expect in an editor setup. I especially like what they did with the concept of blocks, which has expanded my mind about what an editor can contain. On the desktop, the editor works pretty well; there is enough space to support the information the editor will include, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look quite right on mobile.</description>

      <title>Why is fiction important</title>

      <description>So, I have been told that I need to read Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and there is a reason for this. What is that reason? It depends on the importance of knowledge and information to the survival of society, and it&amp;rsquo;s very pertinent today, even though it was written before the Internet was invented.
When was the editor so? I think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up; I need to re-implement it, but I could do/ask if it&amp;rsquo;s there.</description>

      <description>Help me brainstorm a character
Character Crafter
Absolutely, I&amp;rsquo;d love to help you brainstorm a character! Let&amp;rsquo;s start by considering a few key elements:
Archetype: Do you have a specific archetype in mind, such as The Hero, The Rebel, The Sage, or maybe The Innocent? Each archetype brings its own set of traits and narrative possibilities.
Role in Story: Is this character your protagonist, antagonist, a sidekick, or perhaps a mentor figure?</description>

      <description>What are a list of reasons why companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all came from the same area in the PNW?
There are several factors that have contributed to companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all originating from the same region in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Some of the reasons include:
1. Skilled labor pool: The PNW has a strong history of highly skilled workers in fields such as manufacturing, technology, and logistics.</description>

      <title>Naming is Important</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/naming-is-important/</link>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/naming-is-important/</guid>
      <description>Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing.</description>

      <title>Why you aren&#39;t using gRPC</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/why-you-arent-using-grpc/</link>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/why-you-arent-using-grpc/</guid>
      <description>From the first moment I saw it, I thought that gRPC was going to change how people transferred data on the Internet. What are we using? Untyped JSON to REST endpoint? Obviously asking for problems. JSON schema? Better, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write that crap. Also tooling is annoying. GraphQL? Pretty nice. Better than gRPC when dealing with many related objects, but again tooling is eh. gRPC is built on Protobuf, a simple type system that has been battle-hardened by Google and other large companies over the past 20 years.</description>

      <description>Well I have gone down the rabbit hole today on changing the way that everything looks. There are still some blemishes, but there is much more space for writing content. Oh, and I also added an AI feature where if you highlight the text then it will ask you if you want to use that as a prompt and the output will be streamed into the editor. I am super stoked with the progress that I have made here.</description>

      <description>I had some interviews today. In the first one, I was asked a question to which I knew the answer, but the words weren&amp;rsquo;t quite there. I felt myself looping on, thinking of the answer, and then being frustrated. Time passed, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my thoughts into words. Somewhere deep in my knowledge I knew how to respond, but in the moment I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer. Overall, the interviews went fine.</description>

      <title>I wrote some elm today!</title>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/i-wrote-some-elm-today/</guid>
      <description>I had a friend take me on a journey through elm today while on stream today. The exercises they gave me were really well thought out and it was a lot of fun to feel how the code evolved between each task. Starting from a simple counter, it built up to where you were managing a list of list of counters. The cycle of building the thing that just works, and then refactoring it so it could take on more abstraction illustrated why elm&amp;rsquo;s architecture shines.</description>

      <description>A common theme in high thinkies is that I want to record my thoughts in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in my way of my thoughts. For example, writing down notes has been historically difficult and when the thinkies are coming in at blistering speed, it is difficult to keep up. So I started to just talk and record what I said. Audio files are super small. I also started streaming to also document what I was working on.</description>

      <description>If you ask anyone who knows me what my thoughts are on javascript, you will get a unanimous &amp;ldquo;he hates it&amp;rdquo;. Typescript helps, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the problems I have with it are actually solvable without some radical changes in the ecosystem. Why do I care so much? Because I freaking want to build websites that stick around for a while goddamnit! Sites built with the &amp;ldquo;right decisions&amp;rdquo; today feel like they fall over from a strong breeze.</description>

      <description>I am visiting SF right now, and almost every billboard in the city has &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; on it. I need to build image upload so that I can show you what I am talking about. I get it, there is a lot of hype for companies to cash in on, so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?
AI (ML or machine learning for the pedantic) is super cool and can do a lot of things now.</description>

      <description>I like to check in, every so often, on the state of offline-first solutions. Most of what exists is focused around sqlite. Here are some of the projects that pop up frequently when I search:
cr-sqlite
mycelite
sqlite-sync
litesync (not open source)
sqlsync
The appeal of an offline-first experience is pretty well summed up by cr-sqlite&amp;rsquo;s tag line: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like Git, for your data.&amp;rdquo; We are constantly generating data, and in many different ways.</description>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/workflow-engine-syntax-isnt-making-me-happy-halp/</guid>
      <description>I have been building a workflow engine that can route strongly-typed data through durable functions (guaranteed to execute). These functions do not need to exist in the process, they could be remote APIs, grpc servers, a p2p connection with your friend&amp;rsquo;s computer. It supports streaming of data with observables, thanks to rxgo, meaning you can create rules to map, filter, reduce data without redeployment.
This is the sketch I have in my head, and have been trying to implement it here.</description>

      <description>If someone were to talk to me about connecting my body to my mind a decade ago, I would have thought they were full of it. Regularly practicing meditation and now yoga has really made me realize how stupid you must be not to build this connection with yourself. Humans all have this incredible biological computer sitting inside their head and if you treat it as just that, a computer, it can do cool things.</description>

Reload the site at /@breadchris
I should be able to see this post
This flow is a solid step in the direction of where I want to take this tool. With a little bit of tweaking, I now have a way to publish my ideas to the Internet the way that I want to.</description>

      <description>There has been a part of this code that I have been wanting to refactor for a while. Patch on patch of this form has left this code in disarray. This code is actually quite important to this site as well. It is a general application form that leverages the power of Protobuf&amp;rsquo;s expressive type system to generate a form a user can interact with. I have some ideas for where I want to take this code, but they haven&amp;rsquo;t been a priority.</description>

      <description>Idk what happened this morning but I went through my normal routine and then something just hit me which crippled my momentum. I have learned that listening to my body and trying to meet it where it is at in the moment vs trying to fight the feeling pays dividends over time. I try to map the feeling to a probability of what it is that I need. Often this feeling comes from not having enough water, so I drank some water and took a 20 minute nap.</description>

      <description>It bothers me that more people don&amp;rsquo;t have personal sites. In my opinion, we all do interesting things. In order to communicate the interesting things that we do, we need to provide others with an immersive experience of our world. Personal sites of designers and artists attempt to capture our imagination with an elegantly simple and refreshing display of their portfolios or wild 3d graphics. It makes sense why this isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm, these sites take time.</description>

      <description>I had a call with a friend who was a hacker in the golden days of hacking. There were lots of exciting things happening in security as problems were unearthed, and solutions theorized. Over time, these problems that came up became solved. Buffers got compiler and runtime checks. SQL injection doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when you use prepared statements. XSS doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist if you use React. The bread and butter of what hackers were poking at slowly shrunk as companies changed their development practices.</description>

      <description>There are many things that I could be doing. I have spent a lot of time doing cyber security, I have spent a lot of time coding, maybe if I am lucky I could be a baker from all the time I have spent baking. But there is only so much time in the day. There are only so many things that you can get 10,000 hours of mastery over. And even if you have &amp;ldquo;mastered&amp;rdquo; it, have you felt good doing it?</description>

      <description>This post was written by a tool that I have been building for a while, and I think this is the first feature that is remotely helpful. I am writing this post in the browser and it is then going to get saved to the database. When I click the Publish button at the top of this page, then the post will be written to a file in LogSeq where I will push it to Github and link people to it from there.</description>
