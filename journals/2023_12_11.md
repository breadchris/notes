- #buf not suggesting you use this, but was looking at the generated ory sdks and want to share this project https://buf.build/blog/connect-a-better-grpc. TL;DR better grpc tooling that supports json over http (so it works with web). I have been using it in all of my projects and it is a god send. It wouldn't support all the languages you support out of the box, but I can guarantee the tooling for generating the client would be better. Currently supports Go, js, kotlin, swift, but because it is just grpc at the end of the day, you get support for every other grpc language, you just wouldn't get the json/http for those languages with a gateway (not that it matters that much since you really only need http for the web). Fun tech to let percolate through your consciousness. Here is a project I use it in https://github.com/xctf-io/xctf/blob/main/buf.gen.yaml
