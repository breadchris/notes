	- At some point with coding, you will realize that the syntax doesn't matter. You may personally care about what the syntax is taht you type in because you think that certain patterns make you faster than patterns in another lanugage, but what you really care about is how easily you can express your ideas to make the computer do what you want. Syntax matters when you have to learn it because otherwise you aren't able to have your computer actually do anything with the code you have written. It matters when you want others to contribute to your project. The syntax doesn't matter, what matters is how easily you personally are able to use the language. If it takes too long for you to achieve the desired outcome of a program solving the problem that you personally are trying to solve, then the code is not serving you. We write code to direct the skills of a general purpose machine to solve problems. It is an extension of self in the same way a spoken language is. If no one can understand the words you say, then the language is failing you, language is about connecting with others and communicating meaning.
