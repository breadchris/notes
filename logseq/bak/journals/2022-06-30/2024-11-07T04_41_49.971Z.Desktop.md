- go mod has the `replace` directive which is much easier to use for forking and editing code than trying to replace the module name https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref#replace
- Instead of relying on CPEs to provide vulnerability information (since these CPEs are far too often false positives) we are relying on OSV data to provide much more meaningful vulnerability findings. The package name and version ranges are much more reliable for determining if a given vulnerability actually exists in an SBOM than a leaky CPE wildcard match.
- Fixed a number of issues in the UI that are outstanding after moving to the new vulnerability table https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/pull/752
- ### OWASP SAMM
  jot down some notes on https://owaspsamm.org/model/
  [[owasp samm]]
- interesting project https://github.com/owaspsamm/sammwise that asks you the questions from the model
	- these questions are grueling! it would be nice to scale these questions based on the size of the company
	- there should be product recommendations at the end of this so someone can have actionable advice
