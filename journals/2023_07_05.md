	- need to avoid infinite loop when connecting two function nodes together
		- simple fix is to exit if parent or child of function node is another function node
	- should inputs have resources?
	- when executing a function, return it back to the frontend and present the user with a button press to execute the function
		- the executed function triggers a workflow that they can see running
	- add the implementation for `ReasoningEngine`
	- function calling llm that is not gpt4
		- falcon
		- langchain?
	- a number of functions that exist that represent high level business processes
		- what is a business process?
		- what do people do? stakeholders, employees
		- abstract representation of a person

		- forge is where you go to find assets you can include in your own project
	- should another resource type be created for a reasoningengine?
		- by adding another block type, we incur an additional coding cost (more code)
		- by trying to figure out how it exists in the existing system (possibly) or by designing an interface it falls under, a better organization is possible
		- this could be premature optimization though, it already feels distinct.
		- i think it is a node type, not a resource
			- what resource does it belong to?
	- how do you determine what type of block gets included?
	- need to make is super easy to add custom block types and resources
		- everyone has their own idea of abstraction
	- #blog/ideas how to determine if you are making a resource or a node?
	- changes that are needed to add a new resource and node type
