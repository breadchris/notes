- working on error in production that says "failed to insert build dependencies"
  ```
  errorÂ {
  
  code
  
  validation-failed
  
  error
  
  field "project_path" not found in type: 'build_dependency_relationship_insert_input'
  
  path
  
  $.selectionSet.insert_build_dependency_relationship.args.objects[0].project_path
  
  }
  ```
  
  seems like some incorrect metadata?
- fixed go commit problem go [[git]]
	- alex suggestion: only read files from git pack files and do not do a checkout. this would help not modify a repo on disk and avoid any weird checkout problems
- ### ready for defcon
- things that are exiting
	- visual transitive dependency analysis
		- vulnerability ignore in chain?
	- going through vulnerabilities -> projects
	- example vulnerable app?
	- have a guide show up for a vulnerability
	- api access
	- dismiss for X months
- docs for what lunatrace is
- fixing misc bugs in scaning pipeline
	- if an invalid SBOM was uploaded, the scan worker would continue to try to scan an obviously invalid sbom. handled the error more gracefully to avoid spinning
