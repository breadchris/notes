- #go/book #go/interface "The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction."
	- In Go, interfaces are used to define the behavior of an object. Two prominent examples of interfaces in the Go standard library are the `Reader` and `Writer` interfaces. These interfaces are excellent examples of the design principle, "The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction," often attributed to Rob Pike, one of Go's creators.
	- The power of these interfaces lies in their simplicity and the abstraction they provide. By defining minimal interfaces, Go encourages the creation of small, focused implementations that can be easily understood and maintained. This design approach adheres to the principle of small and precise interfaces leading to stronger abstractions.
