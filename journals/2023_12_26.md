	- we are always composing our ideas together
		- every day I open up my journal to compose together a group of tags
		- my browsing history composes a graph of links that I have clicked on
		- messages I have sent people are compositions
			- an insightful thing that I have shared with someone can sometimes be an essay of thoughts
		- there are blog posts, tweets, etc.
		- conversations we have with other people, we compose together our thoughts
	- compositions vary in terms of different variables
		- completeness?
