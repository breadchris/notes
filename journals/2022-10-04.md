When we clone a repo, we need to find all lock files and then we need to run `git log` on that lock file to find all commits where it's been changed.For every change, we go back to that commit and then we re-run the lockfile ingester to generate a build at that given commit.With the package tree ingester, this will be cheap to run.We need to add a column for `git_commit_timestamp` so that we can order commits in SQL.

Analysis we can run:  

-   How long were you vulnerable to a given CVE?
-   How many dependencies were introduced on average per change?
-   How many dependencies are you using over time?

An engineer onboards because they want to see a dashboard of vuln data. To do so, they add a GitHub Action to their repo.This GitHub action downloads the latest LunaTrace CLI every time.It then grabs the package lock files and, the future, it grabs all of the call sites from the code. Then it uploads these to LunaTrace for ingestion.for auth, we can use the GitHub Token OIDC provider.Pros:  

-   Doesn't require the security team to onboard in order to get started
-   Can be done by an individual dev in a lunch break
-   Dangles a carrot because we can show people cool metrics about their code
-   Can be done without any crazy onboarding flow (just requires the action to exist in the repo and that's auth for us!)

I think there is still a bug in the install repo flow when it comes to changing the selected repos.
