		- can I add two numbers from services written in python and go
		- Service A
			- Input: (var1: string, var2: number)
			- Output: (res1: string, res2: error)
		- Service B
			- Input: (var1: string)
		- Output of Service A -> Service B?
			- shim
				- ```
				  out = ServiceA('foo', 1)
				  ServiceB(out.res1)
				  ```
				- ServiceA.output.res1 -> ServiceB.input.var1
				- type(ServiceA.output.res1) ?= type(ServiceB.input.var1)
		- Service A
			- Output: (res1: {something: string, somethingElse: number})
		- Service B
			- Input: (var1: {something: string})
		- type_connection
			- input: ServiceA.output.res1.something
			- output: ServiceB.input.var1.something
		- ServiceAInput
		- ServiceAOutput is equal to the type ServiceBInput
