	- It feels pretty weird to feel different from most people. I'm reflecting on the conversations that I have been having with my friends, and even they are like "woah". It is interesting how you can feel alone when you have this idea in your head that most people don't quite see the bigger picture yet. I guess the Silicon Valley mindset kind of breeds that type of thinking. What I really enjoy about you is that you are doing something completely different from me, and art is literally the study of trying to work on something you just don't understand a lot of the time. Coming to terms with the fact that you are a human trying to make some inanimate object "come to life", like when I see art, I see a computer program that is targeted at the human brain, and good art will "run" in someone's brain and cause them to think about things. And people will think about it so much, that it becomes memorable, like what happened with memes online, lol. I really like that art is this cool balance between wandering in a forest of discovery, and then eventually building amazing structures in the forest (i.e., art movements where people go super deep on some concept). Like Erin, I think you can't un-see Stephen Hannock's work. Isn't his art the perfect framework for the things that you have been exploring personally?

	- Build a consulting business where you pick up other people’s trash
	- You don’t want to pick up trash anymore so you write a script
	- the script isn’t fast enough so you write a program
	- build CRMs to make your life easier before you make a service for users, that’s a different problem
