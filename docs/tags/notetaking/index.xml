      <description>Someone probably looked up one day and said, &amp;ldquo;That is the &amp;lsquo;sky&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; They told their friends, and then they told their friends. At some point, when anyone looked up at the vast expanse above them and needed a way to describe it, the word that came to mind was &amp;ldquo;sky.&amp;rdquo;
Maybe there is something that you are looking at in your life that will have a similar story one day. It might not be as profound as naming &amp;ldquo;sky,&amp;rdquo; but it describes a service we use like &amp;ldquo;Google&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Uber.</description>
