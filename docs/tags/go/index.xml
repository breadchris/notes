      <description>When coding, have you ever stopped to ask the question: why am I doing this? Maybe it is a fleeting thought before you return to squeezing out a few more milliseconds on your page load.
As creators of software and websites, we often get caught up in the never-ending pursuit of optimization. We constantly strive to make our code more efficient, our algorithms faster, and our page load times shorter. But in our relentless quest for optimization, we may lose sight of the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>Testing in software development often finds itself at the tail end of the feature development cycle, sometimes viewed as a necessary evil to uphold code coverage metrics rather than an integral part of the development process. However, the significance of testing cannot be overstatedâ€”the safety net ensures our towering stack of dependencies doesn&amp;rsquo;t collapse at the slightest touch.
A quick Google search on &amp;ldquo; testing&amp;rdquo; unveils a fascinating landscape of testing frameworks across various programming languages.</description>

      <description>It may seem silly, but go run is my favorite part about go. Want to run your code? go run main.go. It is so stupidly simple that I could tell my mom about this command, and she would immediately understand. Like with most things in go, the real power in this command is in the effortless understanding of how to build and run everyone&amp;rsquo;s code.
But I can run node main.</description>

      <description>The goal for this year is to: &amp;ldquo;write and publish something every day.&amp;rdquo; So far I have been doing a good job keeping up with this. In my pursuit to build larger compositions of thoughts, next year will be themed accordingly; I want to write a book. How does one go about choosing the topic to write a book about? It is probably something that you spend a lot of time thinking about.</description>
