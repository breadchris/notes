	- So I made some progress on LunaBrain today. I realized that I need my posts not just to have content, but also metadata. I integrated my cool auto-form-from-protobuf message thing which works well as a POC. All I have to do to update the UI is change the message in protobuf. I think that that in itself would be a really cool tool for people to use, but I don't have an interest in making it at the moment.
