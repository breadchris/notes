- #protoflow/work Continuing to work on streaming data from blocks
	- need to refactor buf code so that it works inside of protoflow for calling a method with reflection
	- buf does not check if there is an error throw, and the error is swallowed silently
	- When invoking a workflow, the input type comes from the first executed block. You should be able to reflect on what this type is and then use it to deserialize the incoming data and stream it to the first block.
	- You can expose blocks that don't quite fit with GRPC as things you can call into, but these should be kept to a minimum
- Signed off on SRP research proposal
	- **The researcher will be investigating the relative difficulty of cyber security challenges posed to competitors of the MCPS HSF ([https://mcpshsf.com](https://mcpshsf.com)) competition. Every year, hundreds of students compete in this competition with skill sets ranging from beginner to advanced. In order to provide adequate challenge difficulty to each competitor level, comprehensive data for various challenge features must be collected and analyzed. The researcher will develop challenges, ranging in difficulty, using the Challenge Generator ([https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen](https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen)) framework, design a study to collect relevant features of a challenge as it relates to a competitor, and perform the study with a mix of in-person/online participants. The data collected will influence the challenge design, as well as educational material presented to competitors and educators.**
