### dream
- at school and was doing a dance off with someone over something 
- was popping and locking all over the place and told nolan i could get a degree in optics if i wanted to 
- i think i wanted to dance because i felt i didn't fit in and wanted some attention 
- every parent died and only kids were left
- there were some bad guys that did that
- i was trying to figure out how to make it work but it was hard
- regular distopian stuff 
- harry potter magical creatures were going to help me fight the people that did that
