### stages of a security analysis rollout
a good security analysis is one that only reports on true positives. to get to this point however, one needs to collect enough data to be confident that this analysis will not annoy the living fuck out of some poor dev (ie. high signal to noise ratio)
- report only
- require a review of findings every quarter
	- this would help the security team determine what is signal vs noise
- report 
	- create tasks and assign them
	- tasks should have detailed context of the issue and remediation steps to promote self service 
	- requires someone to drive remediation 
	- a way to flag this task as invalid
- blocking enforcement
	- at different points of the CI/CD enforce that something can't happen

### what is a day?
i'm awake
orange and yellow blades cut through my room

i'm not going to move, not again
i know what happens when i leave

maybe coffee will wake me up
i hope it hits my veins quickly
god, i don't even know what to say in this pointless meeting
