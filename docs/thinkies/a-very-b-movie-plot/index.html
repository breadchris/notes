COFFEE SHOP - DAY\nISABELLA and JAMES sit across from each other, laughing and enjoying each other’s company.\nJAMES\nYou always make me feel like I’m in a dream when I’m with you.\nISABELLA\nAnd you always make me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world.\nSuddenly, a WOMAN approaches their table.\nWOMAN\nExcuse me, are you Isabella?\nISABELLA\nYes, that’s me. Can I help you?\nWOMAN\nI have something for you. It’s a memory erasing device. You requested to have all memories of James deleted.\nISABELLA and JAMES exchange confused looks.\nISABELLA\nI never requested that. I would never want to forget any moment with James.\nThe WOMAN apologizes and walks away, leaving Isabella and James shaken.\nJAMES\nWhat was that all about? Are you sure you didn’t request that?\nISABELLA\nI swear I didn’t, James. I would never want to erase any memories of us.\nThey both ponder the strange encounter, but ultimately brush it off and continue their day.\nINT. JAMES’ APARTMENT - NIGHT\nIsabella enters James’ apartment, but he seems distant and distracted.\nISABELLA\nJames, what’s wrong? You’ve been acting strange ever since that woman approached us.\nJAMES\nI don’t know, Isabella. It just got me thinking about our relationship.\nISABELLA\nWhat do you mean?\nJAMES\nI’ve been feeling like maybe we’re growing apart. Maybe we’re just not meant to be.\nIsabella is devastated by James’ words, but she refuses to give up on their love.\nISABELLA\nNo, James. I refuse to believe that. Our connection is too strong to let anything come between us.\nJAMES\nI don’t know, Isabella. I need some time to think.\nIsabella leaves James’ apartment, heartbroken and confused.\nINT. ISABELLA’S ART STUDIO - DAY\nIsabella sits at her easel, painting a portrait of James, tears falling down her cheeks.\nSuddenly, the WOMAN from the coffee shop appears in her studio.\nWOMAN\nI’m sorry, Isabella. I made a mistake. It wasn’t you who requested the memory erasing device.\nISABELLA\nThen who did?\nWOMAN\nIt was James. He requested to erase all memories of you.\nIsabella is stunned by the revelation.\nINT. PARK - DAY\nIsabella races to the park where she and James shared so many memories. She finds him sitting on a bench, staring blankly ahead.\nISABELLA\nJames, why did you do it? Why did you want to erase me from your life?\nJAMES\nI don’t know, Isabella. I thought it would be easier to forget than to face the pain of losing you.\nISABELLA\nBut the pain of losing you is so much greater. Our connection is too strong to let anything come between us.\nThey embrace, tears streaming down their faces, as they realize that their love is eternal and cannot be erased.\n",
