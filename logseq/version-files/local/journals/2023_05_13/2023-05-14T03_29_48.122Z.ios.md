- I want to make only fans for technical people where someone who wants to discover more information about some thing can search through someoneâ€™s collected notes or browsing history, or anything else that they look at any given day, and someone can pay money to that person for a curated list of information based off of a question and may be to ask specific questions from the actual human you would have to pay money, but you can ask questions to a bot of that person for free
