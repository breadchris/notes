- Help me develop a web UX for a demo/onboarding/discovery powered by ai ü§ñ
	- Imagine a splash page for Bishop Fox Cosmos that just asks the user for their email and a checkbox saying they have permission to do recon on that domain.
	- Then on the next screen it has a force directed graph at the top with the parent company of the domain in the email provided by the user as the root node on the graph. It has automatically started populating the graph with additional branches and leaf nodes based on subsidiaries, mergers, acquisitions and other business units from pitchbook data.
	- Under the graph is a chat box and the ai says ‚Äúwelcome [name of the customer] to your Cosmos attack surface discovery assistant. I‚Äôm going to help you determine what should be included and excluded from your attack surface for [organization name]‚Äù. this will ask any question to fine tune the customer organization specific model. The user can answer yes, no, or I‚Äôm not sure to each question. However there should not be many questions because most of the discovery will be fully automated behind the scenes.
	- Under the chat box will be an audit log with full detail of all the decisions that the automation made and the customer choices, and anything the attack surface intelligence team does to refine the attack surface.
	- The chat box will also be wired up to slack so the ASI analysts monitoring the customer experience can answer any questions that the chatbot cannot.
