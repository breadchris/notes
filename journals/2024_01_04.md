	- What is something that I can build that I can get 10 people to pay $20 for?
		- I am pretty high now, lets see if I can get to this one later.
		- ok im back.
		- So I was checking out this site: https://omg.lol and I just paid $20 (a year) to check it out. Maybe this is too high for the service, but there are a lot of tools that I could see myself using. I think the UX could be a little more interesting, but the tools are cool. I could continue to develop #lunabrain and morph it into something like this.
		- I love how cute this tool is

		- if you choose to read this, do not expect content that sounds like it is coherent. I assure you, this is just a straight stream of consciousness.
		- I might go out of order when the content comes in (since my brain thinks asynchronously with information coming out)
		- Endless stream of informational content
			- So I just had a hot take on TikTok.
