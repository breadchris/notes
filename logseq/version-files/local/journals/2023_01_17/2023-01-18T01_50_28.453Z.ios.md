- so if i imported a pie recipe, one of the ingredients could be “two sticks of butter”. When I realized by talking to my European friends is that they have no fucking idea what the hell a stick of butter is because butter comes in blocks. So what I can do is use the FDA database to look up what the mass is for one stick of butter  (let’s say that’s 200 grams) so that I can convert the ingredient for the pie recipe from two sticks of butter to 400 g of butter #cookwherever
