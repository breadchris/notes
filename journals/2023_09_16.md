- wrote a script to download songs from spotify via youtube
- #lunabrain/work
	- quiet wants to be able to upload pdfs or text
	- need to handle state better for file uploads
	- what to add
		- openai function calls
			- https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling
			- https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo/blob/main/examples/openai-function-call-example/openai_function_call_example.go
			- example function call will look for phone numbers in what has been said and then let someone text that number with a link to the transcript? session?
			- GOT THIS WORKING!!! it was my #stream/objective
			- i got function calling working
			  9m
			- a POC of it
			- it uses this library https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo/blob/9c8845b2b0194f71a10fde79a3a47ea7a48957c0/examples/openai-function-call-example/openai_function_call_example.go
			  9m
			- but i hooked up protobuf to it, so all you need to do is write a protobuf message and it will generate the json schema
			  8m
			- message GetPhoneNumbersResponse {
			  repeated string phone_numbers = 1;
			  }
			  8m
			- it generates
			  8m
			- {
			    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
			    "$ref": "#/definitions/GetPhoneNumbersResponse",
			    "definitions": {
			        "GetPhoneNumbersResponse": {
			            "properties": {
			                "phone_numbers": {
			                    "items": {
			                        "type": "string"
			                    },
			                    "type": "array"
			                }
			            },
			            "additionalProperties": true,
			            "type": "object",
			            "title": "Get Phone Numbers Response"
			        }
			    }
			  }
			- and then you pass it into that library
			- so you can have chatgpt extract structured data out of unstructured data
			- this is what the live transcription looked like
			- and this is what it extracted: 1234567890
			- now for the apple watch demo, we are going to be talking and when someone says a phone number, the watch will have a pop up message that says "send text to 1234567890?"
			- and it will send a greeting to them based on the context of the conversation, from a base prompt that you have
			- it is like "instant follow up"
			- so you can run questions like this over the transcript and have chatgpt extract their answers
			  Now

		- github integration so that you can see what issues you have open and then gpt generates some questions to ask you
		- live transcribe what is being said in a discord stream
			- https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/blob/master/examples/voice_receive/main.go i dont think this worked
			- https://github.com/CraigChat/craig/tree/master/cook
		- for fun
			- integrate dalle-2 so that you can get images based on what has been talked about

- #protoflow/ideas
	- I want to be able to send data from one piece of software to another without thinking about it
	- clean up protoflow so that it can be used as
		- debugging tool for grpc
		- add a new service, method, message
			- update protobuf
			- generate new files
