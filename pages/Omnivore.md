		- > This time we split the act of learning just into two categories. The first one, I‚Äôll call it "preliminary learning", this is the classic learning that we do in school; we acquire knowledge that might be useful in the future‚Äîwithout being 100% confident that it will in fact be useful. The second category is "on-demand learning", this is the act of acquiring knowledge when the situation demands it, not sooner nor later.

		- > Roja chili is a type of chili pepper that is native to Mexico and is commonly used in Mexican cuisine. It is known for its moderate to hot heat level and its unique flavor, which has hints of fruitiness and a slight bitterness. The chili gets its name from the fact that it is often shaped like a small, red paw or claw. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/chat-gpt-185832ed5c8#41ff79cf-ab63-443e-aaf9-f78b67ce5a72)
