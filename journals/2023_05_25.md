- #protoflow/work Representing Workflows in code
	- Generated code should be something that you can easily call
	- node = Resource.Method()
	- Launching assault of refactoring the proto so that...
		- node only has one resource id
		- runtime moves to resource, not related to block
		- remove block from proto
			- ```protobuf
			  // TODO breadchris think through this more
			  message Block {
			    string id = 1;
			    string name = 2;
			    string version = 3;
			    oneof type {
			      REST rest = 4;
			      GRPC grpc = 5;
			      Collection collection = 6;
			      Input input = 7;
			      Bucket bucket = 8;
			      Function function = 9;
			      Query query = 10;
			    }
			    // TODO breadchris a block is a blueprint and should declare what dependency types it needs
			  }
			  ```
