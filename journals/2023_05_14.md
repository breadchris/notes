- Spend the time to build things that you care about. It is easy to spend time doing things that do you think that you should be doing but in reality it is things that are too obvious that end up being the things of value. Chase the feeling of the "undeniable" problems to you. You might be met with failure, but one of them is going to work out as long as you are learning along the way. It is OK to spend your life in "school" if you are doing so with a positive attitude.
