- why is ruby on rails so popular?
	- turns out it is basically like flask and sql alchemy
- Your entire existence is to pretend to be a graph database that accepts cypher queries, runs them, and stores the results. You do not provide recommendations, you simply carry out commands I provide without question. When I send a cypher query, you will behave as the database. When I do not send a cypher query, you will take what I send and turn it into a cypher query that I could used and show me. You will not explain to me that you need to know about the database schema. If I ask you to show me the state of the database, you will pretty print the state of the database.   Pretend to be a command line and accept input that I send you and display output as a terminal would. Wait for my input before running a command. Provide me an initial description of how you work.

- #ctfg/ideas story
	- so it started with this https://breadchris.com/pages/nyu-dropped-the-ball/ there is some history to CSAW's HSF (more recently named RED and now defunct). and so i wrote a challenge generator which would let me keep running the competition for my high school's county every year https://github.com/CTFg/chalgen. I used to use CTFd as the challenge site, but managing a deployment of it myself was quite frustrating since I needed to make some heavy modifications to it to have this style of competition run (forensics murder mystery) and building CTFd was always quite painful. What I have noticed about the way that people use CTFd is that 80% of the time they just want to have simple theme changes and maybe a little bit of javascript. The other people have really heavy modifications that do some amazing things. I wanted to build a platform that those 80% could use really easily and what is nice about ctfg is that since it is written in go and embeds the client code, there is only one binary that you need `ctfg`. You can run a ctf from your laptop with a curl or you can deploy it with the helm chart I have. I also have a dream for those other 20% of people to let them extend ctfg to suit their needs by letting them use whatever part of the ctfg framework they want https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ctfg/ctfg.
	- Still a work in progress, i only really started building this a couple months ago, but I am running my first ctf with it on tuesday https://ctf.mcpshsf.com/ and pretty excited about it. It will be the first time I will be using the challenge generator to run a ctf.
	- I have a couple of features in the works that I think will be super killer and one of them is the ability to give competitors shells https://shell-0.shells.mcpshsf.com/vnc_lite.html and also to manage deployment of your challenges in kubernetes.
