- #golang/code discord thread creation https://chat.openai.com/share/cbb6f646-b6e5-46a9-b5af-a4534d120e18
- #lunabrain/work
	- what are the things that I want to show off with lunabrain?
	- what if you could link existing resources to some other piece of content that you have generated
		- for example, I started this chatgpt session about building a twitter clone using hugo https://chat.openai.com/share/164f54d4-9af3-45cf-bcc0-df8ba43aab19
		- I want to hand this off to someone else to go deeper on, but there is probably some additional context that would be helpful for someone looking at this, such as the hugo documentation
		- I want to be able to highlight content on chatgpt that I am looking at and then add more information to it
			- More information could be something as simple as adding another link to content
		- For example, I generated this tutorial on Hugo which could be useful context for someone before trying to go deep on the assignment i have for them https://chat.openai.com/share/22de3aea-abed-4bd0-bbbb-100889716364
	- #lunabrain/collect What if you could configure different methods of collection for existing APIs?
		- Import swagger definition, build import
		- Import graphql, build a graphql query to import documents?
	- #lunabrain/wants I want to be able to click on some content and get a content viewer view
		- I really want ((65248b92-a4fc-4f1c-ada6-5b59c344aa9a)) so i am going to try it
			- #lunabrain/ui Need to port react-swipeable-views to tsx https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views/blob/master/packages/react-swipeable-views/src/SwipeableViews.js
	- what if lunabrain could suggest content to a channel in discord?
		- based on what is being talked about, lunabrain can find awesome lists that might be helpful or hackernews posts
	- why cant you change chatgpt content
	- setup instructions
		- config file
			- ```yaml
			  db:
			    debug: false
			  log:
			    level: debug
			  openai:
			    api_key: <api key>
			  service:
			    port: 8080
			    proxy: "http://localhost:8000"
			  scrape:
			    client: chrome
			    fallback: true
			    use_cache: false
			  bucket:
			    path: <some path>
			  python:
			    host: 'localhost:50051'
			  normalize:
			    url:
			      domain_content: true
			  whisper:
			    offline: true
			  youtube:
			    api_key: TODO
			  discord:
			    enabled: false
			    application_id: <application id>
			    token: <discord token>
			  ```
			- which goes `config/lunabrain/config.yaml`
	- #lunabrain/content/code What if you could point lunabrain to a source file in a repo, and you can ask it questions about specific types in code and it would go and gather the relevant information needed to answer by parsing the code
	- the tags are coming from the saved tags array, not the database
- #protoflow/work
	- need to work on the presentation
	- need to improve the workflow
	- when requests are made to an app, record then and let someone pull up the historical requests to immediately try them again
- #internet/communities https://matrix.org/ really interesting project for owning your own chat data
	- also fun to play around with the code
