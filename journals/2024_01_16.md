- #100DaysToOffload Electric Cars in the US
	- Some notes that I came across today about the electric vehicle push in the US.
	- “These incentives complement investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other federal initiatives that are spurring the domestic manufacturing of EVs and batteries and the development of a national EV charging network that provides access to low income and disadvantaged communities.”

	- “What is clear is that the EV, after a slow 15-year drive to mass-market adoption, has turned onto an unfamiliar road. The wealthier early adopters now have the EVs they want, while more modest buyers continue to tiptoe into the market. This legion of curious shoppers still has doubts about the availability of chargers, the range of vehicles within their budget and whether the models rolling out fit their needs.”

	- Driving down the cost of electric vehicles seems like a great idea to me since most Americans drive commuter routes which electric vehicles would have well more than enough juice to take on. Electricity costs next to nothing vs gas. For remote areas of the US, it would be unreasonable to expect them to change what they drive and the legislation doesn’t seem to be forcing anyone to change, it is “Private and Public Sector Investments for Affordable Electric Vehicles” from what I have seen.
