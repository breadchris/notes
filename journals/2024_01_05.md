  collapsed:: true
	- I have gone through a number of gluten-free resources at this point ranging from random online blogs to Modernist Bread's 5 volume set on everything bread. There are a lot of patterns in these books and I hope to distill the information that I have found useful in my gluten free journey.
	- ATK How could it be gluten free
	- Modernist bread
	- Gluten free bread in 5
	- Promises kept or whatever it is called
	- Modernist pantry
	- That research book by the food coalition
	- It was pretty mind blowing when I realized that all gluten-free recipes are just trying to replicate the unique properties of wheat flour and the gluten that is formed when water is added. In this post I want to outline what wheat flour brings to the table, and then what elements go into a state of the art gluten-free bread recipe to replicate this behavior.
	- Gluten-Full Bread Properties
	- Gluten-Free Elements
	- Flours
	- Starches
	- Binders
	- Gums
	- Enzymes
	- While my body requires me to be as gluten-free as possible, I find gluten-free baking as an exciting challenge to push the limits of what we can do as bakers to make something that you can slather jam on or use to complete your favorite sandwich. I personally eat a number of things that I prefer to their gluten-full counterparts, but unfortunately there is a pretty big stigma around gluten-free products just "not being good". I task all the bakers reading this to break down this precognition by baking for your friends and surprise them when they are five cookies deep by telling them what they ate was gluten-free.

	- # American Cooking Basics
	  
	  There are a number of meals that people regularly eat in America. Whether it is something you eat when you are pressed for time (which it seems like we always are) or preparing a meal for a special occasion. In both of these cases, eating something that turns out poorly is not a fun time and can discourage us from trying it again. 
	  
	  Going down my own home cooking journey has led me to find a number of incredible resources from random blog posts to terse cookbooks that read more like textbooks. It is only through reading and then applying the skills I read about did things really start to click for me of how easy it really can be to whip something together to eat.
	  
	  Recipes are amazing at guiding you through how to start with ingredients and sequentially put them together, but without really thinking about what you are doing, you are probably not going to become a "better cook". I really hope through this list of American food basics that you aren't just blindly following what is in the recipe, but rather using all of your senses to understand the transformation that your ingredients go through when you put them together in a recipe. I personally find it super liberating to be able to travel anywhere and be able to work with whatever I have on hand and not having to be dependent on specific amounts of a specific ingredient as far too often you cannot find every ingredient in a list.
	  
	  These recipes also encourage you, when you have the time/equipment for it, to try out different techniques for preparing them. For example, did you know you can make scrambled eggs with a plastic bag, water, and precision cooker (otherwise known as _sous vide_ which is literally just a more powerful fish tank heater)? Understanding the different ways you can make these basic recipes will make you more versatile and allow you to confidently cook in any situation.

  collapsed:: true
	- # 1 Eggs, Dairy, and the Science of Breakfast
	- ## Eggs
	- ### yolk
	  * 75% of calories in an egg
	  * Biologically they are sacks of water with dissolved proteins and larger masses of protein and fat linked together with lecithin
	  * Lecithin is an emulsifying molecule which allows fat and water molecules to exist near each other without separating.
	- ### white
	  * Mostly water with few proteins: Ovalbumin, Ovomucin, Ovotransferrin
	  * Proteins let egg white be whipped and come set when cooked (think of meringue)
	  * These proteins compared to others, such as those found in meat, are already dissolved in a liquid (there is a lot of water in an egg). This allows them to be easily included in other foods (gluten-free breads benefit from the structure these proteins provide when heated).
	  * Each protein reacts differently to heat allowing control over the resulting texture when cooking. 140 degrees F is soft and custard like and 180 degrees F is bouncy and firm
	- ### sizing
	  * USDA sizing standards for minimum weight per egg
	  * Jumbo - 2.5 oz
	  * Extra large - 2.25 oz
	  * Large - 2 oz
	  * Medium - 1.75 oz
	  * Small - 1.5 oz
	  * PeeWee - 1.25 oz
	  * In larger eggs are more likely to find a double yolk
	- ### grades
	  * USDA grading standards
	  * AA - firmest whites, tallest standing yolks, cleanest shells
	  * A - Somewhere between AA and B
	  * B - Watery whites, flat yolks, stained shells
	  * For preparing dishes with eggs as the focal point, a high quality 
	  egg is preffered. When used in baking, the grade will not affect
	  the result.
	- ### Regulated Chicken Conditions
	  * Natural / Farm Fresh - No regulated guaruntees
	  * Free-Range, Free-Roaming, and Cage Free - Chickens are kept in large open barns/warehouses, not battery cages. More room for chickens to do things that they natually do. Labels are not audited, relying on producer to tell the truth.
	  * Certified Organic - Kept in open barn or warehouse, possibly outdoor access. Must be fed organic, all-vegetarian diet without animal by-products, antibiotics, and pesticides. Label is audited by USDA.
	  * Certified Humane - Third-party auditor enforces limits on stocking densities.
	  * Omega-3-Enriched - Chickens are fed supplements from flaxseed or fish oil.
	- ### freshness
	  * The fresher the egg, the more intact a yolk and white will be as the
	  proteins have not had as much time to break down.
	  * To test how fresh an egg is, you can use a bowl of water and observe if it floats. If it floats then it is most likely bad and should not be used. Eggshells are porous and will lose water being in the fridge, a dehumidifier. The evaporated water will be replaced by air between the shell and the inner membrane near the end of the egg where the fat is stored. When the egg is fresh, this air pocket is small, but grows with time until it becomes large enough to cause the egg to become boyant in water.
	  * Aging eggs become more [alkaline](source), or basic, and can affect recipes which
	  are affected by the pH of ingredients. In a meringue, the egg whites
	  are whipped into stiffer peaks by a slightly acidic environment. 
	  If the combined ingredients are not acidic enough, which can happen 
	  with older eggs, the resulting mergine will be wet and more of a liquid.
	  Cream of tartar is used to make the combined ingredients more acidic and
	  counter this effect.
	  * Myth: Older eggs are easier to peel after they have been boiled.
	  False: Older eggs simply produce less attractive boiled eggs as the yolks
	  become uncentered in the egg.
	  * An egg can be safely used 60 to 70 days after the pack date. 
	  * The pack date is a more reliable method for determing how old an egg is. The pack date is a three-digit number directly above the sell-by date. The three numbers indicate the day of the year that it was packed on (ie. 001 is January 1st and 365 is December 31st). While it is not possible to determine exactly what day the eggs were laid, legally manufacturers have up to 30 days to clean and pack eggs. After this pack date, the sell-by date can be set up to 45 days later. Considering both these dates, buying a carton of eggs on their expiration date means they could be up to 75 days old.
	  * The cuticle of an egg is a thin, wax-like coating that exists on the egg when it is first laid. This is a protective coating for the incubating chick which prevents bacterial infection and moisture loss (since the shell is pourous). In the United States, USDA-stamped eggs have the cuticle removed before they are packed. With this protective layer removed, refrigeration is imparative to keep out bacterial infection. In farmers markets or Euorpean stores you can find this cuticle kept intact and eggs can be kept safely at room temperature.
	  * Pasturized eggs have been submerged in a 130F water bath for long enough to kill harmful bacteria 
	  * Color of an eggshell (white or brown) comes from the different breed of chicken.
	- ### boiling 
	  * Definition: When vapor pressure of a liquid is greater than or equal to atmospheric pressure that surrounds it.
	  * Analogy: Water is made of molecules, in the same way a crowd at a concert is made of people. At a concert with a single piano player playing a soft ballad, the crowd will be silently listening, sitting in their seats. Replace this piano player with chaotic energy of a Van Halen solo shredding on his guitar, and the crowd will start to become active and possibly start _moshing_ or violently running into and pushing each other. If these enthusiastic concert goers are bound by some sort of barrier, it is possible they might break free and move into other parts of the venue. In a pot of water, it might not be obvious, but there is a barrier keeping these water molecules from escaping and it is the pressure from the atmosphere pushing down. As you add heat to the bottom of the pot, the water molecules nearest to the source of heat, just like people closest to the speakers at a concert, will start to get excited and bump into other molecules. Once the molecules all the way in the back, or at the top of the pot, start to get really excited, they break free and _evaporate_ in the form of steam or water vapor. Seeing their molecule friends escaping, the rest of the water in the pot starts to do the same. The temperature that water does this is at 212F or 100C. 
	  
	  | Name | Temperature Range | Description |
	  |------|-------------------|-------------|
	  | Quivering | 130F - 170F | Small bubbles of water vapor form at nucleation sites at the bottom of the pot. Surface of water quivers from bubbles attempting to surface, but not quite getting there. |
	  | Subsimmer | 170F - 195F | Small bubbles from the bottom and sides rise to the surface. Streams of small bubbles look like a champagne in a glass. |
	  | Simmer | 195F - 212F | Bubbles break surface of water regularly from all parts of the pot. |
	  | Full boil | 212F | Water vapor escapes rapidly and pot cannot get any hotter. A pressure cooker can increase the temperature beyond this point. |
	  
	  * To more easily peel eggs, lower them into already boiling water instead 
	  heating them from cold water. Eggs peel more easily when their proteins 
	  are not bound to the shell.
	  * Types
	  * Hard-boiled
	  * White: Set, not rubbery
	  * Yolk: Bright yellow and creamy yolk, not chalky or crumbly.
	  * Soft-boiled
	  * White: Set white
	  * Yolk: Liquid, ooze like custard
	- ### Heat and Eggs
	  
	  Cooking eggs is crazy, there are so many ways to do it! We can thank the fact that there are so many different proteins which all respond to heat differently. Because of all the moving parts an an egg, time and temperature are very imporant to keep track of if you are looking to make the best eggs you have ever had.
	  
	  ![unraveling of egg protein](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/09/science/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)
	  
	  > Proteins are essentially coiled balls of yarn. When you introduce them to heat, they start to unravel. Just like a box full of unravelled yarn, the unravelled proteins will overlap each other and create a thick mess. We call the process of a protein unravelling, *denaturing*. I like to think of all of these unravelled proteins as "chemistry noodles".
	  #### Egg White and Temperature
	  What happens to the egg white as heat increases.
	  
	  | Temperature Range | Description |
	  |-------------------|-------------|
	  | 30F - 140F | The egg white's proteins begin to denature. |
	  | 140F | _Ovotransferrin_, a protein in the white, starts to unravel and bonds to itself. The result is a matrix of proteins which makes the white milkly and jelly-like. |
	  | 155F | _Ovotransferrin_ becomes an opaque solid. Egg white is soft and moist. |
	  | 180F | _Ovalbumin_, the main protein in the egg white, will cross-link and solidifiy. The egg white becomes firm, but remains tender. |
	  | > 180F | As temperature increases, the proteins will bond more tightly and will wring out water from the egg like when squeezing a wet towel. Hydrogen sulfide, or the "rotten egg smell", will form and your eggs just aren't going to smell good. |
	- #### Egg Yolk and Temperature
	  What happens to the egg yolk as heat increases.
	  
	  | Temperature Range | Description |
	  |-------------------|-------------|
	  | 145F | The proteins being to denature, making the yolk thicker. |
	  | 158F | Egg yolk is dark, translucent, and firm. Texture is like fudge. It can be cut with a fork. |
	  | 158F - 170F | Yolk becomes firmer until it turns pale and crumbly. |
	  | > 170F | More and more crumbly. The sulfer in the egg white and iron in the yolk react and create _ferrous sulfide_. This molecule makes the outside of the yolk turn slightly green.

	  | 1 to 3 minutes | Outer white set just enough to allow egg to retain its shape when carefully peeled | Salad or pasta where the uncooked egg will emulsify with other ingredients; they’re not pleasant to eat on their own. |
	  | 4 minutes | White is opaque nearly all the way through but retains a bit of translucency next to the yolk; yolk is barely warm and completely raw | Serve as a topping to vegetables or grains; place on top of blanched asparagus or green beans or in a bowl of noodle soup. |
	  | 5 minutes | White is opaque but still quivering and barely set toward the yolk; yolk is warm but completely raw | Breakfast |
	  | 6 minutes | White is opaque, firm all the way through; yolk is warm and starting to firm up at the edges | Breakfast |
	  | 7 minutes | White is fully cooked and as hard as that of a hard-boiled egg; yolk is golden and liquid in the center but beginning to set around the edges	| Breakfast |

	  // TODO
	- ### Eggs Benedict
	  // TODO
	- ### Eggs Florentine
	  // TODO
	- ### Fried Eggs
	- #### Concepts
	  How do we have an egg white come set, which happens at around 155F, but the not overcook the egg yolk, which will start to become firm at 145F? Cooking two things at the same time with the same heat source is tricky, but thinking about chemistry and thermodynamics for a second (I promise it isn't anything too crazy!) we can figure out how to make the perfect fried egg.
	  
	  Refering back to what we know about the chemistry of eggs, the yolk is filled with fat. Animals that live in cold climates use fat to keep themselves warm since fat is a good _insulator_. A good insulator will change temperature more slowly than a poor insulator, meaning it will become cold slowly _and_ become hot slowly. In science terms, an insulator transfers energy very inefficiently, or it is a poor _conductor_.
	  
	  Additionally, if cracked carefully into the pan, the yolk will sit _on top of_ the white. All of the heat that the yolk will be affected by will have to go through the egg white first. Our egg white will also act as an insulator for our yolk!
	- #### Effect of Temperature on an Egg in a Pan
	  
	  Let's take a look at what would happen if we put an egg in a pan heated to different temperatures.
	  
	  | Temperature | Affect |
	  |-------------|--------|
	  | Low Heat | Even though the yolk and white are insulated differently, the slow, steady heat of the pan will cause them to change temperature at nearly the same rate. This means we will see the yolk become completely firm and chalky before the egg white has a chance to become set. |
	  | Medium Heat | The egg yolk contains some amount of liquid on top, away from the heat of the pan, while the bottom, closer to the heat, has become firm. The white has become fully white and has started to brown. |
	  | High Heat | Egg whites become completely set, but because the yolk is well insulated, the heat has not had a chance to warm it up and so it is still all liquid. |
	  
	  While you can cook an egg in a perfectly smooth, non-stick pan, it is a good idea to use some sort of oil or butter to make sure the egg won't stick as well as add more flavor/texture.
	  
	  * Butter - Milk proteins will brown (more on browning [here](TODO)) and transfer to the egg giving it a rich taste
	  * Oil - Eggs are slightly more crispier, but with a cleaner taste.
	  
	  By using a shallow pool of oil with your eggs, you can spoon some of the oil on top of the eggs so that they are being cooked from all sides. This will help cook the egg whites quickly white protecting our precious yolk from becoming too firm.
	- #### Ingredients
	  * 2 large eggs
	  * 3 tbsp butter
	  * Function: fat
	  * Subs:
	  * olive oil
	  * Salt and pepper
	- #### Equipment
	  * Pan
	  * Surface: Non-stick
	  * Spoon
	  * Spatula
	  * Plate
	  * Optional: Paper towels
	- #### Directions
	  1. Heat fat in pan until...
	  * Observe: if using olive oil, you start to see whisps of smoke.
	  * Observe: if using butter, wait until the bubbling stops.
	  * Also: place a paper towel on the plate. This will help absorb the oil from the eggs once they are done.
	  2. Crack eggs carefully right over top of the surface of the pan so that the yolk is sitting comfortably on top of the white.
	  3. Tilt the pan, barely, so that the fat pools to one side.
	  4. Scoop the fat onto the egg whites until they are set and crispy.
	  * Time: 1 minute
	  5. Take the eggs out of the pan with a spatula and put them on the plate.
	- ### Scrambled Eggs
	- #### Concepts
	  
	  In any scrambled eggs recipe, the fatty egg yolk is first mixed together with the mainly protein white. While this mixture may seem simple, there are a number of moving parts which can greatly change the outcome. To understand how scrambled eggs can either be rich, dense, and creamy or light, slightly dry, and fluffy, it is important to consider the [chemistry of an egg](TODO) and [how water boils](TODO).
	  
	  We know that eggs contain a lot of water

	- #blog/ideas Quarantine Pies
		- A little over a year ago, I really would not call myself a baker. Baking to me was going to our grocery store, going into the baking aisle, and picking a Betty Crocker mix to throw into a bowl with oil and eggs. It wasn't until Thanksgiving of 2019 that I attempted something as daring as making a pie from scratch. 
		  It was an apple pie, and I remember the recipe distinctly because it didn't call for mixing the sugar mixture in with the apples, but putting the sugar mixture over top of a fully assembled pie (with the dough sealing in the raw, sliced apples). Even though I had never made an apple pie, I of course had eaten a lot apple pie and knew the way it was supposed to look, and looking at the sugar mixture sitting on top, slowly oozing its way through cracks it could find between the apples looked odd. But I was committed to making this pie and so I threw it into the oven and awaited the results of my creation. Even before it was done, the entire house had swelled with the smell of cinnamon, butter and apples; the smell that anchors your consciousness in childhood memories of playing in leaves, pumpkin picking, family gatherings where everyone is smiling and having a good time (and definitely not at each other's throats over some small argument). Coming out of the oven, the pie looked magnificent, I was thoroughly surprised. I had no expectations for how it would turn out, but I felt pretty good about it for my first attempt. The sugar on the top had caramelized (not that I even knew what the word 'caramelized' even meant at this point) giving the top an interesting texture along with the dough.
		  
		  I don't remember how the pie actually turned out, or if it even tasted good by my standards for pie today, but I definitely remember enjoying it thoroughly.
		  
		  Up until this point I wouldn't say I was really "into pies" but this definitely flipped a switch within me to dive deeper into exploring this newfound love of circular baked goods filled with fruit. I found myself doing extensive research into what apple pie recipes existed online and would occasionally try one out when I read about a different technique for preparing one (ex. cooking the apples on the stove before putting them in the crust, using different kinds of apples, etc.). Baking began to feel more of a research project than making something to satisfy my craving of sugar and butter.
		  
		  March 14, 2020 was coming up (otherwise known as 'Pi' Day as the numerical date is 3/14 or 3.14), and being the nerd that I am, I decided to have some fun with it this year. At this point I was set on eventually making the best apple pie the world had ever seen, and so Pi Day was the perfect time to make some pies and collect some data from my test subjects (this was not an approved human research study, but full consent was received from my friends and they were compensated with pie). Me and one of my friends put together 13 pies with the intention of answering the questions: What is the best configuration of apples? Does it make a difference to cook the apples before they are put into the oven? Do people like the drier filling caused by baking a pie with a lattice top vs a fully closed top? I collected some data, but I realized that it was not a study that would produce conclusive results as there was no control pie and I wanted to answer too many questions at once. What I did realize though, was that different people definitely had their own individual preferences and making a "perfect pie" isn't so much as making a silver bullet as it is tailoring a pie to someone's pallet. 
		  
		  After Pi Day, I went on my annual spring trip home and ended up staying longer than expected due to the Covid pandemic quarantine. Now, being told to stay inside all day,  having full reign over my parents newly renovated kitchen, and a full house is the perfect recipe for making and eating lots of pies. I made every configuration of apple pie I could find a recipe for or think of: gluten-free apple pie, keto(-ish) apple pie, candied ginger apple pie, apple pie in a cast iron, and a number of others that I gave to those fighting Covid.
		  
		  The creativity cloud burst when I found America's Test Kitchen's - The Perfect Pie. It became my sacred text. It had every pie I had ever heard of and then a whole swath of others ranging from French tarts to regional US favorites. It reshaped what a "pie" was for me. I wanted to make all of them
		  
		  Whenever I had the opportunity during the quarantine to travel to another bubble of people I insisted that I made them a pie. Up and down the east coast I tried to make a pie that was related to that region. I picked apples at my friends farm in Albany, made a cheddar cheese crust in the Poconos, brought a Dutch apple pie to my friend's Pennsylvania proposal, and baked a Tar Heel pie in the Outer Banks. When I got back to the Pacific North West, I foraged for blueberries to use in a blueberry pie, cut off some rhubarb and strawberries in my friends garden. And of course there are opportunities for word play with pies like: having a Baked Alaska in Alaska and a Turkey Pot Pot Pie for Thanksgiving (a mind blowing flavor experience). My friends and I had a Michelin Star Restaurant night where we all dressed up and each put together the fanciest thing we could prepare. My contribution was a lavender creme brule pie which I finished on the table with a blow torch.
		  
		  Pies are a dessert meant to be shared. They can bring people together for a meal with the promise of having a special dessert. There is a stark difference between a Sarah Lee pumpkin pie and one that you have made from fresh pumpkins that you have picked from a farm, and people can taste the difference. A pie becomes special when you can feel its flaky crust and its fresh filling. Someone who isn't a pie connoisseur will notice when compromises have been made in the baking process.
		  
		  I would probably say that I am a "baker" at this point, but I am still a long ways from my goals with baking. Stay tuned for more pie related posts on this blog :)

	- Why people don't cook more
		- * "upfront cost" - https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/teo7l9/why_do_some_people_act_like_cooking_is_more/
		- So I have been cooking for a while. Well not that long when you look at how many days I have been on this earth, but it feels like a while. I started cooking during covid when there was nothing else to do but be inside. But the thing is, I am an engineer. Like pretty nerdy, tech bro kind of engineer. And to me, good cooking was an art. It was something that felt unobtainable. How could I ever eat a hamburger I could make myself that was as good as McDonald's Quarter Pounder? I would make myself burgers, but they were always dry. McDonalds must just know how to do it better than me. It was a special occasion for me to go eat out. And when I did, it was something super special. The food that I would get was nothing that I had ever been able to make myself. Going to the grocery store, they had foods that I didn't have the slightest clue how it was made. Bread? I had hardly ever had a good muffin I made myself, let alone a whole loaf of bread.
		- I would watch Chef Ramsey, Martha Stewart, and Racheal Ray in perfectly manicured sets, ingredients mise en place, ready to be simply dumped in while they recite the recipe they have learned from their Grandma or inspired by a friend who runs Spain's most famous restaurant. A knife can cut through their tomato that easily? The inside of that steak is that red? Jesus christ, how the hell did they make that happen.

	- America is having an identity crisis. A powerful force on the world stage, but still very much a "startup" of a country. An ambitious youth that rebelled against its parents and left the house to make a difference in the world. The promise land for those around the world want better for themselves and their family.
	- The sole existence of the US was to fight tyranny. Decisions made by one person tend to not work out the best for everyone over time.
	- "We are going to build massive prisms in the dessert that will last longer the gods themselves" "Who is going to build them?" "The slaves of course!"
	- American cooking is interesting. Rapid expansion and a tenacious work ethic from immigrants pouring into the US defined american cuisine. Fast food, across the world, is directly associated with the US. Meat was and is the main ingredient of choice for the busy family. Dense in calories, easily frozen, delicious when cooked, it is no surprise that this is the case. Being very easy to come by in the sprawling farms across the country, access to this food was easy.
	- Health wise, there could be better ingredients you turn to when planning your meals long term.
	- When I think of breakfast in the US, it is hard not to think about diners. Polished chrome, pastel green, blue, red, a family outing, a late night oasis for the lonely traveler. Diners perfectly capture the relationship between Americans and food. Large portions of potatoes, eggs, bacon, pancakes, coming out as quickly as you can say "2 stack with sausage".
	- What has really interested me with cooking is the actual raw ingredients that come from the ground. Growing up drinking cherry "flavored" Capri sun from a plastic pouch, I LOVED these drinks. It was a privilege to have these in our lunch or at sports games. But, for some reason, I didn't like cherries themselves. They just didn't have any flavor and it was so much work to pit them. Who would eat these? Well, it turns out the cherry flavoring is really a chemical that was developed in a lab to replicate what a cherry AT ITS BEST tasted like. I had never seen a cherry tree before. I didn't grow up watching the small bulbs appear on the tree and over time turn into succulent deep dark red cherries. I didn't understand that fruit had a SEASON. A fleeting moment during the summer when a cherry was filled with sweet sugar bestowed upon it from the tree on which it grew. Taking the cherry too early, and there is no sugar, too late and they have fallen to the ground where the earth eats them up. But, there are cherries in supermarkets? Yes, but HOW DID THEY GET THERE. Most cherries in the US come from X. For them to be transported from there to Maryland where I lived would be X miles. From picking the cherries to them being bought by me and eaten, it probably would have been about 2 weeks.  Over that time, the cherries are losing their flavor to the natural chemical reactions that occur when you throw time at them. I would rather have the potent chemical cherry flavor over the vaguely cherry sacks of water, thank you.
	- So why do people like cherries? Well, as I found out later in life, these people seek out farmers or more local farmers markets where the cherries have been picked the day before. All the flavor is still there. What the cherry flavor is based on, but couldn't hold a candle to, is in these freshly picked cherries. Plump skin that gives way and releases the complex flesh of sweet and sour is what a cherry should be. If you haven't experienced this in a cherry, you haven't had one yet.
	- The US is INCREDILY good at making anything you could dream of available to you within an arms reach. The X from the USSR visited an Aldis in Texas and said that the head of the USSR doesn't even have this access to a variety of food.
	- What supermarkets can't deliver  to you fresh, they have a well researched recipe that employs the latest in food science to make sure it can sit in a warehouse for weeks before it ends up on the shelve to be bought. Wheat is one of the most researched ingredients since bread is so integral to an American's diet. Additives preserve a loaf of bread far longer than a fresh load made of only flour, water, yeast, and salt ever could. Check the freezer isle next time you are in a grocery store, you might find some bread that comprises on covienience for the sake of simple ingredients.
	- When you can buy anything you could dream of, you don't question what it is. Unfortunately, when you don't have someone who is fighting for your taste buds, you are going to get the person who is fighting for more money. The person who is in it for money, is probably going to create a product that appeals to our primal senses, without a care for how healthy it is. Loading cookies with fat and sugar is an easy way to sell more cookies. No lemons? No problem, let's mix some mouth watering citric acid and way too much sugar and call it lemonade. People will buy it.
	- Grocery stores have changed for me. I don't walk through every asile anymore. I have actually realized that the dazzling display of colors, logos, brands that make up the aisles are pretty overwhelming! That is a TON of information to process, let alone when you find what you are looking for and there are 20 different versions and brands to choose from. Grocery stores for me are a couple of aisles. They are the ones with the raw ingredients. Vegetables, fruit, butter, milk, eggs. Cereal aisle? Are you kidding me? Who thought an entire section devoted to a bowl of sugar was a good idea? Oh right, the people fighting for money. The chip, soda, candy aisles I go to once in a while if I want a snack. But wow! There are so many! And in such large quantities.
	- I want to change what America is known for when it comes to food. I don't want to change what food we make, I love it (waiter, another cheese burger please). I want to change how we make it. What ingredients are we using? Where do they come from? Are there steps we can take while preparing the food that make it turn out 1% better? Can we take shortcuts without the expense of someone's health? Lets weaponize our powerful food distribution system to incentivize fresh, local produce that reduces the energy needed to have it delivered. If we harness the power of the community to put a demand on quality, we redirect the efforts of the people who are in it for money. The organic movement in grocery stores is a testimate to the power of consumer demand, however it isn't without its draw backs. Being labeled as "organic" is an expensive process that small local farms simply can't afford.
	- I don't want to give you recipes in this book. There are so many out there, and some of them are probably better than the ones I have here. In fact, I don't even want you to follow the recipes from this book. I would rather you use the site I put together, but hey I totally get wanting to unplug from a screen and follow words on a page (I do all the time). What I want you to do with this book is glance at it from time to time. Read the table of contents, twice, and slap the book shut, put it on your shelf, and go about your day, month, year, life. I want you to order fast food, make pasta, go to a restaurant, order food from a food truck. And while you are doing this, be curious, be present. "Oh baby these bbq wings SLAP! But what did they put in here?" If you find yourself asking these questions, remember back to this book and the fact that there is a bbq wing recipe. If you are compelled to go back home and read the section on bbq wings, it will not disappoint. You may not learn how to replicate those wings EXACTLY, but you will learn how to make wings that SLAP, I guarantee it. Make them for yourself, your friends, your partner, your family, and see how they react. My mom had a saying when something turned out well: "restaurant quality". Every recipe in this book is "restaurant quality", and I give you a number of ways to achieve that. Are you in a pinch and need it done quickly? I'll show you how to make those eggs turn out the best they can without even thinking about it.
	- You are going to make mistakes, that's ok. I tried my best to capture all the ways something can go wrong and how to recover. I love the idea of a "foolproof" recipe where there is very little room for something to get messed up. Checkpoints and observations you can make break up each step into a very straight forward process. Unfamiliar with a referenced technique? No problem, every special cooking technique is explained in detail.
	- Being a teacher, I understand how important it is to address the different types of learning resources that people need. Sometimes you want to read, watch, or listen. Every recipe has (obviously) written directions, but also a video you can watch. If you follow the recipe in the app, the video is broken up into each step so you can watch it as many times as you need to.
