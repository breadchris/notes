      <title>The Go Proposal Process</title>

      <description>Underneath the syntax and runtime is a very important system that is often overlooked in a language. Usually, there is &amp;ldquo;the person&amp;rdquo; who built the language, and successful languages often come from the person wanting a language to suit their needs, not finding one, and then making their own. Over time, more people want to use the language, and balancing constraints of what is included or not included in a language becomes challenging.</description>

      <title>notes about coroutines?</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/notes-about-coroutines/</link>

      <description>Even though the &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; keyword is the same name as the language, you would think this is more commonly used. From my experience, go developers, including myself, will avoid using go routines and channels as much as possible. The reason is that it adds complexity that you often don&amp;rsquo;t need. Concurrent code unlocks a lot of performance as tasks that would otherwise &amp;ldquo;stop the world&amp;rdquo; only stop the go routine that they are on.</description>

      <description>I feel like being put on a hospital bed and prodded every time I am in an interview. A rigid agenda of a strange conversation where the person on the other end is trying to profile you. It is an extraordinary interaction that I really hope improves over time. I usually get greeted by a nice interviewer, or someone trying to play nice at least, for the roles I am applying to.</description>

      <description>As the flickering lights of monitors illuminate the shadowed visage of a hacker, known in the cyber realms as Zero Cool, the mind behind the screen drifts away from the usual code and into the realm of daily organization. Amid the clutter of local Apple Notes, a thought emerges, tinged with the desire for something more open, more connected. “What if,” muses Zero Cool, “my notes could seamlessly sync with the very fabric of my digital life?</description>

      <description>Website vs web app, what is the difference? How do you know how to make the tradeoffs in terms of complexity for a spa vs the simple HTML of templates? Managing state in the DOM is not easy, dynamic components require managing of more state. How does htmx relate?</description>

      <description>The debate between statically and dynamically typed languages has always been a hot topic in software development. Designing types for a problem can feel like solving a puzzle—fun for some and frustrating for others. But the real question is: Do you know how to represent the domain? While the alpha engineer may claim they do, understanding a domain comes from observing patterns over time.
The challenge in business, where code is most commonly used, is collecting and understanding the data needed to define these types accurately.</description>

      <description>In the realm of software development, the dichotomy between local development environments and production settings presents a notable challenge. The ideal scenario is where both environments mirror each other as closely as possible, minimizing discrepancies that can lead to unexpected behaviors upon deployment. However, achieving this level of synchronization is fraught with complexities. Tools like Docker have emerged as potential solutions, offering the promise of containerization to encapsulate applications in self-contained units that can run consistently across various environments.</description>

      <title>go dependency injection</title>

      <description>Dependency injection has radically increased my programming rate. When everything is designed as a module, you find yourself constantly reusing things you have already written since it is the path of least resistance.
If you try to do this without the help of a framework, you will find yourself writing and rewriting the boilerplate code to connect dependencies together. Most DI frameworks resolve dependency graphs at runtime https://github.com/uber-go/fx
A dependency graph resolved at runtime is error prone and leads to confusing code.</description>

      <description>In response to my previous post:
martinsos:
I like it, very practical and honest! No preaching, just direct opinions. Quite fresh for a web dev article. Btw I competely shared that view on Tailwind that you had at the start, and I still have it in part, just because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to learn more of it. It still seems weird that we are putting all the style directly into html, I can&amp;rsquo;t read that and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the intention, but I think I read they are not against classes at the end, it is just that even them you woudl then define with Tailwind.</description>

      <description>I get that it took a while for IRCv3 to come out, but the more I think about my ideal form of communication, the more it looks like IRC. I mostly communicate with Simple text comms, with the occasional voice/video chat. I also want to be able to write bots to receive and send messages on channels. Moderation controls are important for larger channels.
There is a Go server/client implementation, ergo, that I am excited to try out.</description>

      <title>anatomy of syntax</title>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/anatomy-of-syntax/</guid>
      <description>Something I do not see often in programming language books is a concise explanation of semantic structures that are typically used. For example, in a Java method, there are different modifiers you can apply to the function to change how it behaves (public, private, static, etc.) Usually, the syntax is introduced and it is talked about at length, covering the many edge cases that might exist or the syntax is introduced in passing as an example requires a reader&amp;rsquo;s comprehension of the topic, referencing a later section for the explaination.</description>

      <description>When coding, have you ever stopped to ask the question: why am I doing this? Maybe it is a fleeting thought before you return to squeezing out a few more milliseconds on your page load.
As creators of software and websites, we often get caught up in the never-ending pursuit of optimization. We constantly strive to make our code more efficient, our algorithms faster, and our page load times shorter. But in our relentless quest for optimization, we may lose sight of the bigger picture.</description>

Designing Data Driven Applications by Martin Kleppmann - amazon
Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers.</description>

      <description>Testing in software development often finds itself at the tail end of the feature development cycle, sometimes viewed as a necessary evil to uphold code coverage metrics rather than an integral part of the development process. However, the significance of testing cannot be overstated—the safety net ensures our towering stack of dependencies doesn&amp;rsquo;t collapse at the slightest touch.
A quick Google search on &amp;ldquo; testing&amp;rdquo; unveils a fascinating landscape of testing frameworks across various programming languages.</description>

      <description>Their lovemaking was passionate, if quiet; she felt every atom of her body, his body, heavy in their node of space/time, replete with potential. Calvin breathed harshly beneath her, and she threw her hips into it with vigorous intensity, pressuring and sliding away from the place where their bodies were joined in abandon and rapidity. His eyes fluttered closed and he had to muffle a hoarse shout, and she felt him coming inside of her; when his thumb slid up to caress her clitoris, with a touch both gentle and firm, she came, too; and then again, as he returned the touch almost as soon as the first wave of convulsions had left her.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, staring at something long enough is all it takes to figure out what to improve.
I moved from the TipTap editor to BlockNote, built on TipTap, but it comes with all the features I would expect in an editor setup. I especially like what they did with the concept of blocks, which has expanded my mind about what an editor can contain. On the desktop, the editor works pretty well; there is enough space to support the information the editor will include, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look quite right on mobile.</description>

      <description>So, I have been told that I need to read Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and there is a reason for this. What is that reason? It depends on the importance of knowledge and information to the survival of society, and it&amp;rsquo;s very pertinent today, even though it was written before the Internet was invented.
When was the editor so? I think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up; I need to re-implement it, but I could do/ask if it&amp;rsquo;s there.</description>

Character Crafter
Absolutely, I&amp;rsquo;d love to help you brainstorm a character! Let&amp;rsquo;s start by considering a few key elements:
Archetype: Do you have a specific archetype in mind, such as The Hero, The Rebel, The Sage, or maybe The Innocent? Each archetype brings its own set of traits and narrative possibilities.
Role in Story: Is this character your protagonist, antagonist, a sidekick, or perhaps a mentor figure?</description>

There are several factors that have contributed to companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all originating from the same region in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Some of the reasons include:
1. Skilled labor pool: The PNW has a strong history of highly skilled workers in fields such as manufacturing, technology, and logistics.</description>

      <description>Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing.</description>

      <description>From the first moment I saw it, I thought that gRPC was going to change how people transferred data on the Internet. What are we using? Untyped JSON to REST endpoint? Obviously asking for problems. JSON schema? Better, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write that crap. Also tooling is annoying. GraphQL? Pretty nice. Better than gRPC when dealing with many related objects, but again tooling is eh. gRPC is built on Protobuf, a simple type system that has been battle-hardened by Google and other large companies over the past 20 years.</description>

      <description>Well I have gone down the rabbit hole today on changing the way that everything looks. There are still some blemishes, but there is much more space for writing content. Oh, and I also added an AI feature where if you highlight the text then it will ask you if you want to use that as a prompt and the output will be streamed into the editor. I am super stoked with the progress that I have made here.</description>

I felt myself looping on, thinking of the answer, and then being frustrated. Time passed, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my thoughts into words. Somewhere deep in my knowledge I knew how to respond, but in the moment I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer. Overall, the interviews went fine.</description>

      <description>I had a friend take me on a journey through elm today while on stream today. The exercises they gave me were really well thought out and it was a lot of fun to feel how the code evolved between each task. Starting from a simple counter, it built up to where you were managing a list of list of counters. The cycle of building the thing that just works, and then refactoring it so it could take on more abstraction illustrated why elm&amp;rsquo;s architecture shines.</description>

      <description>A common theme in high thinkies is that I want to record my thoughts in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in my way of my thoughts. For example, writing down notes has been historically difficult and when the thinkies are coming in at blistering speed, it is difficult to keep up. So I started to just talk and record what I said. Audio files are super small. I also started streaming to also document what I was working on.</description>

      <description>If you ask anyone who knows me what my thoughts are on javascript, you will get a unanimous &amp;ldquo;he hates it&amp;rdquo;. Typescript helps, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the problems I have with it are actually solvable without some radical changes in the ecosystem. Why do I care so much? Because I freaking want to build websites that stick around for a while goddamnit! Sites built with the &amp;ldquo;right decisions&amp;rdquo; today feel like they fall over from a strong breeze.</description>

      <title>SF Feels like another Planet</title>

      <description>I am visiting SF right now, and almost every billboard in the city has &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; on it. I need to build image upload so that I can show you what I am talking about. I get it, there is a lot of hype for companies to cash in on, so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?
AI (ML or machine learning for the pedantic) is super cool and can do a lot of things now.</description>

      <description>I like to check in, every so often, on the state of offline-first solutions. Most of what exists is focused around sqlite. Here are some of the projects that pop up frequently when I search:
cr-sqlite
mycelite
sqlite-sync
litesync (not open source)
sqlsync
The appeal of an offline-first experience is pretty well summed up by cr-sqlite&amp;rsquo;s tag line: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like Git, for your data.&amp;rdquo; We are constantly generating data, and in many different ways.</description>

      <description>Someone shared this with me today. They said: &amp;ldquo;yeah when I read this I thought of your exact thing lol&amp;rdquo;. So it turns out that I am on to something. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how well I am meeting Andrej&amp;rsquo;s ideal blogging platform:
Writing
✅ in markdown
✅ with full WYSIWYG, not just split view (think: Typora)
I am using https://tiptap.dev/ super easy to copy paste and add images</description>

ones that need to hold up to scrutiny like an essay
long cohesive ideas that are meant to take you on an all encompassing journey, like a book</description>

      <title>Workflow Engine syntax isn&#39;t making me happy, halp</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/workflow-engine-syntax-isnt-making-me-happy-halp/</link>

      <description>I have been building a workflow engine that can route strongly-typed data through durable functions (guaranteed to execute). These functions do not need to exist in the process, they could be remote APIs, grpc servers, a p2p connection with your friend&amp;rsquo;s computer. It supports streaming of data with observables, thanks to rxgo, meaning you can create rules to map, filter, reduce data without redeployment.
This is the sketch I have in my head, and have been trying to implement it here.</description>

      <title>Connecting your body and your mind</title>

      <description>If someone were to talk to me about connecting my body to my mind a decade ago, I would have thought they were full of it. Regularly practicing meditation and now yoga has really made me realize how stupid you must be not to build this connection with yourself. Humans all have this incredible biological computer sitting inside their head and if you treat it as just that, a computer, it can do cool things.</description>

      <description>So if my calculations are right, I should be able to do the following:
Save this post with the tag #100daystooffload
Click publish above
Reload the site at /@breadchris
I should be able to see this post
This flow is a solid step in the direction of where I want to take this tool. With a little bit of tweaking, I now have a way to publish my ideas to the Internet the way that I want to.</description>

      <title>What is a good refactoring task?</title>

      <guid>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/what-is-a-good-refactoring-task/</guid>
      <description>There has been a part of this code that I have been wanting to refactor for a while. Patch on patch of this form has left this code in disarray. This code is actually quite important to this site as well. It is a general application form that leverages the power of Protobuf&amp;rsquo;s expressive type system to generate a form a user can interact with. I have some ideas for where I want to take this code, but they haven&amp;rsquo;t been a priority.</description>

      <description>Idk what happened this morning but I went through my normal routine and then something just hit me which crippled my momentum. I have learned that listening to my body and trying to meet it where it is at in the moment vs trying to fight the feeling pays dividends over time. I try to map the feeling to a probability of what it is that I need. Often this feeling comes from not having enough water, so I drank some water and took a 20 minute nap.</description>

      <title>Why aren&#39;t there more personal sites?</title>

      <description>It bothers me that more people don&amp;rsquo;t have personal sites. In my opinion, we all do interesting things. In order to communicate the interesting things that we do, we need to provide others with an immersive experience of our world. Personal sites of designers and artists attempt to capture our imagination with an elegantly simple and refreshing display of their portfolios or wild 3d graphics. It makes sense why this isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm, these sites take time.</description>

      <description>I had a call with a friend who was a hacker in the golden days of hacking. There were lots of exciting things happening in security as problems were unearthed, and solutions theorized. Over time, these problems that came up became solved. Buffers got compiler and runtime checks. SQL injection doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when you use prepared statements. XSS doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist if you use React. The bread and butter of what hackers were poking at slowly shrunk as companies changed their development practices.</description>

      <description>There are many things that I could be doing. I have spent a lot of time doing cyber security, I have spent a lot of time coding, maybe if I am lucky I could be a baker from all the time I have spent baking. But there is only so much time in the day. There are only so many things that you can get 10,000 hours of mastery over. And even if you have &amp;ldquo;mastered&amp;rdquo; it, have you felt good doing it?</description>

      <description>I think there are some really cool things that you get when you dogfood the thing you are building. For those who are unfamiliar with &amp;ldquo;dogfood&amp;rdquo;, as it relates to the tech world, it means to use it yourself. I have not had much focus on the projects that I have been working on, and now that I am directly dogfooding the app, which aims to help me increase the frequency and quality of how I write, I am held accountable.</description>

      <description>This post was written by a tool that I have been building for a while, and I think this is the first feature that is remotely helpful. I am writing this post in the browser and it is then going to get saved to the database. When I click the Publish button at the top of this page, then the post will be written to a file in LogSeq where I will push it to Github and link people to it from there.</description>
