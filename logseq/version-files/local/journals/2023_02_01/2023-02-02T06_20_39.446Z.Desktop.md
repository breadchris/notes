- downloading maven artifacts #lunasec
	- https://github.com/square/maven-archeologist API to collect information about a package
	- https://mvnrepository.com/popular popular java packages
		- could start with this list and then crawl all dependencies
	- analysis of maven artifacts https://medium.com/@almyre/a-journey-at-the-heart-of-2-4-million-maven-artifacts-94f73038bba4
	- could replicate packages from here https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/
	- all java repositories indexed by maven https://mvnrepository.com/repos
- #lunasec/work vulnerability search page should be better
	- I should be able to search by package
		- see all the vulnerabilities a package has
	- search by popularity data
	- search by CWE (with helpful descriptions of each)
	- see a timeline of vulnerabilities
- https://same.energy/feed/Paintings search for things visually
- make website that shows what song is currently playing for spotify
