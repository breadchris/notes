		- > If something is worth taking away from this article, it is that taking the time to do preliminary learning really pays off in the long run. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/on-demand-learning-is-ruining-the-tech-industry-185834306fe#7b7b3b6c-ad7d-4996-acf3-b7e59836aae6)
		- > This time we split the act of learning just into two categories. The first one, I’ll call it "preliminary learning", this is the classic learning that we do in school; we acquire knowledge that might be useful in the future—without being 100% confident that it will in fact be useful. The second category is "on-demand learning", this is the act of acquiring knowledge when the situation demands it, not sooner nor later.

		- > If you think your behavior is not affected by such trivialities, think again. Even on a subconscious level, you will resist even opening apps that don’t reward you with snappy response times. Which is a problem because the apps most people turn to for reading are either ebook apps like iBooks and Kindle, or web browsers like Chrome and Safari. I’m not sure which category is slower, but they’re both abysmal. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-185832bc6b8#2bb7c4a7-add9-48be-ac05-30abb1f49043)

		- > Roja chili is a type of chili pepper that is native to Mexico and is commonly used in Mexican cuisine. It is known for its moderate to hot heat level and its unique flavor, which has hints of fruitiness and a slight bitterness. The chili gets its name from the fact that it is often shaped like a small, red paw or claw. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/chat-gpt-185832ed5c8#41ff79cf-ab63-443e-aaf9-f78b67ce5a72)
