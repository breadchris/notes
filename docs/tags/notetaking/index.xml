      <description>Someone probably looked up one day and said, &amp;ldquo;That is the &amp;lsquo;sky&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; They told their friends, and then they told their friends. At some point, when anyone looked up at the vast expanse above them and needed a way to describe it, the word that came to mind was &amp;ldquo;sky.&amp;rdquo;
The word sky comes from the Old Norse sky, meaning &amp;lsquo;cloud, abode of God&amp;rsquo;. The Norse term is also the source of the Old English scēo, which shares the same Indo-European base as the classical Latin obscūrus, meaning &amp;lsquo;obscure.</description>
