	- what went well
		- it was fucking sick
		- shells were useful
	- what didn’t go well
		- couldn’t access wiki site from a chromebook
			- had to use phone or shell
			- enumerated list of all links beforehand present that to MCPS IT
			- chromebook CI to check if links are working
			- not as much of a problem if everyone has VNC
			- persistent volume for shells so compeittion evidence doesn't go away
			- https://github.com/kvdi/kvdi
		- database went down
			- no PVC
			- no backups
		- shared document was a nightmare
			- estep
				- team logs in
				- link to document
			- shared markdown
			- as much as possible day of, no external dependencies
		- login to ctfg seemed unreliable?
			- writing tests
			- admin page
				- view teams progress
				- view team report
				- filtering/sorting
		- shells were going down sporadically
			- pods went down, they weren’t deployments
			- too many resources
			- hit quota
		- communicating with competitors was difficult
			- did not have pages to post info or a push chat
