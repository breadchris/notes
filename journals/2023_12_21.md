	  Perspective on AI in cybersecurity:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ezhHln-P4
	  Penetration Testing Augmentation & Automation:https://www.pentestmuse.ai
	  Working on automated authenticated API testing with our new Bishop Fox intern, a PhD candidate from Stanford https://github.com/pentestmuse-ai/pentestmuse
	  Testing LLM Integrations:https://slides.com/robragan/testing-llms
	  LLM Integration Vulnerability Findings Templates:https://github.com/bishopfox/llm-testing-findings
	  Data Model Security:
	  Illustrative architecture of how NOT to build a data model as this one is vulnerable to data leakage:  https://huggingface.co/Theoradical
	  Releasing a more secure design pattern developers to follow soon. Our customers have asked for examples their engineering team can follow and I’ve always found it’s valuable in secure coding training to show “what not to do”, as much as it is valuable to show examples to follow.
	  Have a talk drafted, and submitted to BlackHat Asia for mathematically proving how much a model will leak sensitive data or hallucinate sensitive data.
	  Drafted another talk on evaluating open-source models.
