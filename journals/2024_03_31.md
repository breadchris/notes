- #go/book Service Pattern
	- For people coming from OOP land, Go can be quite jarring. It is deceptively close to OOP type programming, but it is distinctly different. Concepts like "abstract classes" are almost approximated by embedding structs, but not quite. The good news is that there is just not that much that you need to learn to master Go. A pattern that is worth studying is the service pattern in Go. A service can be thought of as a container, rather than a class. It can contain dependencies or state that is needed. The main components of a service is the struct type, the container, a constructor, usually named NewThing, and methods which make use of things from the container. If you ever find yourself writing a method that does not use anything from the container, it should probably just be a function. The last part that is commonly associated with this pattern is the interface. Be careful with prematurely defining an interface for your service, it will get in the way of figuring out what your service's methods should look like.
