### TODO
- updating grype's code to fix bug with matching npm 
	- grype/version/format.go FormatFromPkgType can have `java-archive` which is not covered by the switch statement
- review [forrest's document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJwpz4pF7_pfGmfC3H82AtgPVE4Is-6_4nidiNi8nsI/edit) to include possible scenarios that someone is using the tool and expect to experience

 ### Getting done
- debugging `builds_to_scan` table to understand why the error "more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression. null" is happening
- attempting to fix the issue with this sql for the view:
 ```sql
SELECT *  
FROM (  
    SELECT DISTINCT project_id  
    FROM public.builds  
) project_groups  
JOIN (  
    SELECT *  
    FROM public.builds  
    ORDER BY build_number DESC  
    LIMIT 10  
) builds_inner ON builds_inner.project_id = project_groups.project_id  
-- UNION SELECT * FROM public.latest_default_builds  
ORDER BY project_groups.project_id, builds_inner.build_number;
```
update `default_branch_builds`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.default_branch_builds AS
SELECT build.*
FROM public.builds AS build
JOIN public.projects AS project
    ON project.id = build.project_id
JOIN public.github_repositories AS github_repository
    ON project.id = github_repository.project_id
WHERE build.git_branch = github_repository.default_branch
AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.scans WHERE build_id = build.id);
```
