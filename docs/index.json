Either I or someone else who vaguely understands how to code was going to hack you like this. Business requirements for shipping that feature out at lighting speed for your largest customer last quarter made this all too easy.\nconst asdf = () =\u0026gt; {} Your company\u0026rsquo;s site uses javascript. It has a package.json that\u0026rsquo;s filled with dependencies. It is probably fair to say you are using at least one of the top 1000 most popular javascript packages. Go ahead, find one that you use:\nselect package -\u0026gt; package X\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at package X. It has N lines of code and is maintained by M number of maintainers. But wait, there is more. What about the packages package X depends on? Well, it turns out there are D of them. And if you were to consider all of the maintainers of those packages, there are M\u0026rsquo; of them. Pretty wild.\nWhy would you care about this? Well let me lay out a scenario. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I am a hacker that wanted to hack your company. Knowing that your company\u0026rsquo;s site uses package X, I can have some fun with your site. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious, package X\u0026rsquo;s code and all of packages it depends on code all have full access to your site. That means they could run whatever code they wanted to. Credit card number is entered into a form? Sounds juicy. Maybe I just want to show all your users some dancing cats. I\u0026rsquo;m sure they would love that. Let\u0026rsquo;s go and do that.\nWell, most of package X and its dependencies have their code hosted on Github and I have fabricated what looks to be a reputable account here. Look at me, such an outstanding open source contributor.\nOne of the packages that X depends on is package Y.\nPackage Y has N open issues for bug fixes or feature requests and I am sure they could use some help with some code. I\u0026rsquo;ll spend a few hours to work on some code to resolve issue # and I\u0026rsquo;ll send it over to package Y\u0026rsquo;s maintainers. It might look like this.\nFortunately I made quick work of this issue because I had a helpful library lying around that did most of the work for me. I feel like my changes are pretty reasonable and it would be a no brainer for a maintainer to accept this code. Maybe there are a few tweaks to make, but odds are pretty good I can get that code landed.\nCool, so when my code gets landed, the maintainer will cut a new release at some point and my code will be running in your company\u0026rsquo;s site once you bump your version or blow away your package lock like you normally do.\nWhat are the odds the maintainer actually looked at that dependency I added? How often do you spend a single second looking at the package you are about to include into your app? If you are a good developer, I would give you a minute of looking at the docs, API, maybe the tests. But have you really scanned through all the files? Did you check the scripts section of package.json? I sure as hell don\u0026rsquo;t do this for every package I install, let alone all the other packages it installs. How can I when my manager is breathing down my neck?\nOk, ok, lets say you really are the engineer of the year and you poked and proded my PR and checked out the source code for the library I added. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t go ahead and look, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait. I would expect that your search hasn\u0026rsquo;t actually turned up anything that could be considered \u0026ldquo;malware\u0026rdquo;. Maybe you found a bug, but errornous lines don\u0026rsquo;t really matter to me when I am stealing passwords from your users.\nThe malicious code isn\u0026rsquo;t in the source code, it\u0026rsquo;s in NPM. Before I release a version of my dependency to the npm registry, I tack on a little more javascript. You would only see this javascript if you were to directly download the dependency and open it up (link). Didn\u0026rsquo;t see that one coming did ya? I made the JS obvious here, but what if it looked more like this: xxx Is that easier to read?\nYou might laugh at this attack vector, \u0026ldquo;wow great, you are going to land some code and then a year from now when we bump our package version you can hack our site\u0026rdquo;. Well, the thing is I already have spent a year doing this to your site. I fingerprinted the dependencies that your site has from your source maps and script tags. I\u0026rsquo;ve been resolving issues like this for the past year, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have the slightest idea which dependencies are actually trojan horses for my exploit code.\n\u0026ldquo;Why would I ever accept your PR? It includes an unnecessary dependency! If I were that maintainer, I would tell you to write those lines yourself.\u0026rdquo; Well, if you think that way, you obviously aren\u0026rsquo;t a javascript developer. Micropackages are encouraged. That is how development is done in Javascript land. In fact, take a look at this graph showing how many packages Package X has included over time:\nMost Stack Overflow answers to Javascript developers has at least one person suggesting to use a package to fix the problem. Maybe I will start suggesting my own packages as answers to questions\u0026hellip;\nOh also, this isn\u0026rsquo;t hypothetical, it has already happened. Bitpay was targeted by this attack, and the hacker was only caught because he called a deprecated function that node printed a warning about. Knowing how they got caught, only make my malware stronger. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take an experienced hacker or really anyone with any security experience to do this. In fact, a regular developer would probably be more equipped that me to execute this attack because they probably know those weird forgotten about packages better than me.\nYou know what, next time I hack your site, I am not going to wait around for some developer to accept my PR. I wonder how hard it would be to find a developer who is down on their luck and offer them a good amount of money, a hard earned wage, in exchange for them including my library in their project to help me \u0026ldquo;get my feet off the ground\u0026rdquo; as a fellow developer applying for jobs.\nWe know this attack is happening, and us at LunaSec are building the future of protection from this type of attack. We aren\u0026rsquo;t waiting around for some security researcher to raise the next alarm and deal with the fire drill of responding to these incidents. No, we are automatically eradicating this problem by using our knowledge as security researchers and developers to design an intelligent, automated system that silently protects you and your company\u0026rsquo;s code.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:8001/pages/i-hacked-your-site/","summary":"It isn\u0026rsquo;t your fault, you were just doing your job.

Finger Tutting is a popular dance style based around creating angles, shapes and boxes with your fingers practiced by many dance crews (Jabbawockeez, Les Twins, etc) and even some celebrities. For gloving, it’s an essential. Entire teams and styles are based around Tutting and every top glover integrates it into their show in at least a small way.\nEvery glover integrates Finger Tutting into their style.\nImages\nVideos\nVariations\nWave Tutting\nTutting\nCreatures\nStacking Details\nStacking is placing one hand on top of the other over and over again in different variations so it gives your hands a look like they’re being “stacked.” Stacking is one of a small number of concepts that has no clear origins in any other dance style.

Typically only a few lights are left on at a time and then transferred from finger-to-finger by clicking one light off and the other one on. The effect this gives is one of pure magic, as the glover is able to make lights disappear and reappear in a flash\nConjuring you gain knowledge of the viewers focal point, and they are also good practice for mode changes. One of the least practiced styles in gloving but one of the techniques that will amaze the casual audience.\nImages\nVideos\nWho Uses It\nMunch\nWarrior\nMez\nMode Switching Details\nMode switching is the act of changing your mode to a different color and flashing pattern selection in the middle of a show by either clicking the buttons on the lights, or an accelerometer trigger. Mode changing is effective for accenting speed control, like when glovers switch to a blinky set during slow, more technical times, and switching to a much more trail inducing set during faster motions.\nMode changing keeps your viewer on the edge of their seat. Knowing how the modes on your lights are laid out is crucial for this technique, as you must be able to anticipate what’s coming next. Simple things like changing colors or patterns really introduce a wow factor for your viewers, as it is often unexpected.\nWho Uses It\nFlow\nMateria\nIce Kream Teddy\nThe Grid Details\nA structured representation of the space in front of you.

The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU. It feels disrespectful to all of the volunteers (you and I included) that worked so hard to not just maintain the quality of the program, but to make it 1% better every year, and make sure everything was in place for it to keep running.\nThe issue has stemmed from the push of making CSAW an international competition. The student volunteers were burdened with trying to handle this rapid expansion on the fly and the quality of the competition suffered. There was no longer anything \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; about CSAW since you can\u0026rsquo;t have physical challenges when everything needs to be run in 10 different places. High school students and teachers all experienced this massive drop in quality and care for the competition. CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop. NYU dropped their golden egg.\nThis was one of the reasons I decided to drop out of NYU. I was being offered a fantastic job at Uber, while having to fight to try to keep the security lab that special place that made it what it was. We weren\u0026rsquo;t able to have a two time HSF finalist get accepted into NYU. Most finalists don\u0026rsquo;t even consider going to NYU as they usually have their sights set on CMU, MIT, etc. A friend of mine, a three time finalist, only decided to go because he would be paid to go to NYU. Another friend would also have been paid, but decided to go elsewhere.\nThere is no competition on the planet that embraces the spirit of HSF (as it was). CTFs encourage a fire and forget mentality, once you have learned the patterns you need to learn. In fighting to preserve the HSF format, I was repeatedly told that HSF would not scale, and that was the reason why it became a CTF for highschoolers.\nI wrote this challenge generator, partially out of frustration, to prove that it was possible to scale a competition that encourages cohesive problem solving skills. And even more importantly, it teaches students how to communicate the work that they have done and rewards them for spending that time. The ex-HSF finalists that I still stay in communication with, who remember how HSF was, are frothing at the mouth at the idea of this competition coming back.\nMy dream with rebooting HSF is to preserve the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; that you feel when you spend a week perusing the evidence, only to look at something for the 10th time and see what you were missing. Or being at finals and being given a phone and a \u0026ldquo;good luck\u0026rdquo;. You were the one who showed me how special this competition was. We had facetime, as highschoolers, with real government agents doing this for a living.\nI want to have a package that I can give to a community college that has a teacher that cares about cyber security, and show them how to run this for themselves. If we want to improve the cyber security talent pipeline, we have to fight to find those sleeping creative thinkers and give them a sanctuary to practice the dark arts of cyber security. NYU did not fight for this sanctuary, and the program suffered.\nThe reason I am so passionate about this competition is that it literally has made me who I am. When I applied to colleges, I applied to 13 colleges and only got into UMD and NYU. UMD gave me no scholarship money (even though I gave a presentation to the senior class of UMD\u0026rsquo;s Cyber Aces program, sponsored by Northrup Grumman, on what it was like to intern there since I had interned at NG for two years). NYU didn\u0026rsquo;t just give me money for being a finalist, but I talked to Joy (the year before she was let go) and she cared enough to make it remotely financially feasible for me to go there. CSAW brought the best high school/collegiate cyber security talent into the same room, for multiple days, every year. The roommates that I live with are HSF finalists. Because of CSAW, a national network of introverts has been solidified and is bringing the future of cyber security, and I reap the benefits of it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:8001/pages/nyu-dropped-the-ball/","summary":"How it went wrong I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time.
