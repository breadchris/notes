- #protoflow/work
	- need to work on the presentation #conference/seagl/talk #protoflow/talk
		- figure out what I want to say about it
		- i want to make it a debugging tool
		- what are the 3 questions that I want someone to walk away from the talk asking themselves?
			- Are there things that I have felt in programming that are like LEGOs for code?
			- When I play with code, what do I want to build?
				- Is it something simple, complex?
			- Do I want to write more code with my friends?
	- When you have the chat open, you can click on a block
		- the block view should have a search
	- The interface should be service oriented, and it should be easy to
		- add new services and methods
		- update the type of a method/service
		- kind of like https://www.prismabuilder.io ![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 9.55.58 PM.png](../assets/Screenshot_2023-10-18_at_9.55.58 PM_1697691361616_0.png)

- #lunabrain/work
	- what are the features that I want to show kevin?
	- I need to make tags connected to groups
		- i think i updated the model
	- you need to be able to comment on posts
	- you can host whatever static content you want off of "domain.lunabrain.com"
		- maybe you need approval to do this
	- production might be broken
	- add an alpha disclaimer at the top
		- make login only?
	- social login?
	- create a prompt type
		- need to add text input? finish the markup content saving
	- I want to be able to take my chat gpt conversations and turn those into blog posts
		- extension extracts the content from the page
			- or by watching network requests?
		- content is saved in lunabrain
		- you can "publish" the content to your personal site "username.lunabrain.com" using hugo?
	- would you pay for a service where based on your browsing history (which you can set whitelists/rules for), you get AI generated blog post drafts that it sends to you and after a thumbs up from you/minor edits you get to publish it to a personalized domain "<username>.site.com"  which is SEO optimized
		- what about collaborating on cultivating refinined resources via voting and commenting with a group
