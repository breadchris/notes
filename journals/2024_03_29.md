- #go/book figuring out where code goes
	- It is too easy to spend a lot of time trying to figure out where code goes. You may think that you are doing work, and planning out how the future of your repository is going to look or feel. The truth is 9 times out of 10 you are going to be wrong with your forecasting of your code. Conceptual models that work for you, might not work for other members on your team, and you will have a standoff at high noon to settle where the interfaces should be defined.
	- The flow of development that I generally practice for things like this is breaking code shared code into functions. Dependencies declared in the parameters, and no side effects, ie. functional code.
	- This makes the function very portable and can be easily refactored to anywhere else in the code. As multiple of these functions seem to want to be grouped together (similar dependencies), they get their own service (type Service struct {}).
	- It is helpful to study other projects and how they organize code. I like to keep packages as shallow as possible, prefer more directories next to each other, rather than nested folders. What can I say, Java has traumatized me.
