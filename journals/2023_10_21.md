	- I want my chatgpt sessions saved so that I can search through them
	- related content vs referenced content
	- #lunabrain/wants
		- i want to be able to leave some note and make some mention
		- i want to be able to send people notifications via an app
		- i want to collect all the instagram reels erin and I send to each other so that I can have a "tv show" i can watch that is just cute things that we have
	- turn chatgpt sessions into SEO blog posts
		- kind of an interesting idea, I would start using it
	- change content over to using entgo https://github.com/ent/ent/blob/master/examples/o2mrecur/example_test.go
		- I don't think you need to move everything over, I think you could just start with content
