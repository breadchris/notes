	- trying to get competition propped up
	- trying to build locally, ran into problems
	- codespaces works so well
	- because i was building on an m1 mac, there was an exec error when pushing to kubes
		- `--platform linux/amd64`
	- I want to get rid of all the python from this goddamn repo
	- what are the order of operations that I can do in order to get xctf to a place that is better?
		- working on #protoflow would help because I can build services and types for things more easily
			- need to build python service
	- ```bash
	  python main.py comp gen -f competitions/mcpshsf-2023 --reg-url=gcr.io/mcps-hsf-316519/ --base-url=mcpshsf.com
	  ```
- #protoflow/ideas
	- docker-compose UI builder
		- it should be super simple to run a docker-compose app
