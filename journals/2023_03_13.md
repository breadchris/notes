	- everyone in the world is doing a cash grab for "scaling a business"
	- [5:15 PM]
	  
	  they are bootstraping on products and services they dont understand
	- [5:15 PM]
	  
	  technologies their contractors barely know
	- [5:15 PM]
	  
	  all to essentially store and retrieve data
	- [5:16 PM]
	  
	  the stacks that people are building on are 10 years old since that is when the developer last learned something new
	- [5:16 PM]
	  
	  it costs money to learn new things
	- [5:16 PM]
	  
	  additionally, tight timelines for rapidly delivering code are not conducive to writing things that are remotely secure
	- [5:16 PM]
	  
	  but the thing is, memory corruption doesnt exist
	- [5:17 PM]
	  
	  there are very few places where it does, and those places are where everyone in the world has been focusing their security energy for the past 20 years
	- [5:17 PM]
	  
	  ex. browsers, phones
	- [5:18 PM]
	  
	  yes there are new vulnerabilities found every year in these devices, but the amount of effort required to even remotely make the exploit stable takes an entire year to do
	- [5:18 PM]
	  
	  and in that year, security engineers and developers are collaborating to change the way software development works to improve security
	- [5:19 PM]
	  
	  android rewrote their bluetooth stack to address the security concerns and it went from multiple RCEs a month to one or two in the past year
	- [5:19 PM]
	  
	  ctfs do not teach business logic bugs to the extent that they exist in the real world
	- [5:19 PM]
	  
	  micro service architectures are built in memory safe languages, but their auth/authz is swiss cheese
	- [5:20 PM]
	  
	  if you are going to do ctf style hacking, the closest you can get is in sandboxing challenges
	- understanding permission models and exploiting them
