	- hook up parent nodes to input of node being wired up
	- [[Protoflow Node Types]]
	- Nodes should be represented more generally on the graph
	- Edges are grouped into different layers
		- Different layers for edges means that you can hide
		- Layers have different rules defined for them of what types of nodes can be connected to which
		- For every edge, the parent and child's relationship is well defined, undefined relationships result in a "connection error"
		- A workflow is defined by passing input to an entry node, and the graph that is accessible to the node is traversed.
			- A node may depend on another node's execution, even if the parent node has not been traversed yet. Since the node depends on this data, the data must be provided.
		- A workflow is first "connected" by configuring all nodes, and their dependencies, so that a node may produce data when executed.
			- The connection phase hooks all nodes up to each other using reactive programming design.
		- After connection, the workflow is initiated by streaming input into the entrypoint node's input. All side effects of the workflow executing will send data to listeners of the observer.
		- Edges can have various reactive programming properties defined on them (such as batching)
	- if a function node already has a type specified, prefer that type
	- protoflow should be embeddable into another application
		- you should be able to define custom node types and call them how you see fit
		- other developers will need to see this for the ideas to stick
	- protobuf message transformer
		- connect two protobuf messages to each other
		- configure this transformation on an edge
	- secret provider
	- layers can reference each other
		- a routing layer can "go deeper" when you click on the expand
			- being able to drill down on granularity is a major dev ex feature
	- need to make a router mux to serve responses for http requests going through protoflow
	- make workflow data viewer
