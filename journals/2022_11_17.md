- hook up cwe library into lunatrace
- #golang #cwe https://github.com/kotakanbe/go-cwe-dictionary
- project management https://linear.app/
- #lunasec #cwe we should probably be ingesting cwes into the database, but for a POC it should be fine to have them
- grouping vulnerabilities by CWE
	- ingest cwe dictionary
		- id
		- name
		- description
	- ingest cwe hierarchy
		- id
		- parentid <- there can be multiple parents
	- we might want to have our own groupings/overrides?
