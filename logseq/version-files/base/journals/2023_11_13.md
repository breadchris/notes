- #xctf/work
	- how do we want to guide educators through the usage of xctf?
		- I want them to see AI
			- build a story with it
		- make simple challenges
			- point and click challenge creation
			- each challenge has a wiki page with step by step instructions for solving
		- share built challenges with other educators
	- need to move from twirp to connect
- #lunabrain/work
	- clean up mobile view
	- get everything using entgo?
	- when @ or # is typed into the text box, fill options are available
	- comments can be left on content
	- #lunabrain/ideas Make creating and sharing lists of data as easy as pie.
	- maybe try out rxjs? https://github.com/re-rxjs/react-rxjs-github-issues-example/blob/master/src/state.ts#L69
	- it is still annoying to setup the http router, but stdlib http router is better
