- #protoflow/talk
	- I want people to refine their sense on what a LEGO for code feels like
	- We should strive to build code that feels like this so that we can try to make coding more accessible to ourselves and others

		- You want to code with LEGOs, not Mega Blocks
		- LEGOs hold up to scrutiny, and also don't over promise on what they are.
		- We tend to have pretty good judgement, even as kids, what toys are better than others
		- This is my attempt at taking what I have learned about LEGOs and about code, and trying to make writing code feel more like playing with LEGOs, because I really just miss doing that lol
		- Legos
			- The first LEGO set I ever had came from Mcdonalds, probably one of the last toys you could get in a happy meal that had any redeeming quality
			- After I built it for the first time, I allegedly would walk around with it all the time
			- I would fall asleep with it
			- I noticed that these pieces didn't have to be arranged in the way I was told to do so by the instructions. I could build whatever I wanted.
			- I remember how deeply satisfying it was to arrange and rearrange this limited set of pieces   into whatever I could think of. With a little imagination a crude representation could become what I wanted it to be.
			- Buying and building LEGOs became a fixation for me. Turning a whole section of the basement into my lair filled with new sets, partially disassembled sets, and random pieces from eroded sets from years past.
			- I think my mom got me a Mega Blocks set once and somehow the pieces ended up in one of these bins. Whenever I was looting around for pieces and I came across these pieces, they would immediately throw them away. But even if a single LEGO piece was found laying around the house, I would pick it up and return it to the bin.
			- It is an honest mistake Mom, Mega Blocks look so similar to LEGOs why would I care so much?
			- I don't know if you have had a chance to play around LEGOs all that much, but they are a very special toy to me. LEGO year after year showed what was possible to build with their catalog of bricks and to me then, and now, it is mind blowing.
			- There are many design principles that keep LEGO being LEGO. And the brand has only ever faltered when they deviated from this set of design principles.
		- Building something simple
		  collapsed:: true
			- Is there a quintessential LEGO build, maybe a car/house?
			- For code, you might think of a TODO app
			- What could be simpler, and fundamentally helpful than displaying a list of things on a screen for someone to use a computer to help them keep track?
			- If you search "TODO MVC" you will find an endless number of projects, that all look quite different, trying to show you how to code this.
			- If you try to take the code for any one of these projects and put it in your own app, you will probably fail.
				- Dependencies will be out of date
				- They are incompatible
				- The code uses forgotten functions
			- If something as simple as a TODO app brings about this much complexity, does that feel like a LEGO brick you could use in your code?
			- With the explosion of open source software and packages that flying off the package registry's shelf, how can you tell which ones are more like LEGOs vs Mega Blocks?
		- Cooking
			- I don't play with LEGOs anymore, but I like to cook
			- I like to think of recipes as really just the composition of different recipes together to make something even more complicated
			- Peanut butter and jelly
				- Peanuts + blender = peanut butter
				- Stawberries + pectin = jelly
				- flour + water + yeast + salt = bread
				- bread + peanut butter + jelly = pb&j
			- We don't really write recipes like this though
			- Expect for literally [Cooking for Engineers](https://www.cookingforengineers.com)
			- If I want to make cool things in the kitchen, I have to follow normie language for expressing recipes
			- But I want my
			- I wanted to build a foundational piece of software that people could build upon to help people save and view recipes.
			- How would I do that?
			- Whenever something bothered me while following a recipe, I would take note of it and try to write code to fix it.
			- Because I wanted to improve how recipes felt when you followed them, I needed to build a solid front end
			- The last time I had really done this was with jQuery, and we all know how that goes
			- There are hard problems in software development, and building good websites is certainly one of them
			- Trying to rapidly prototype features in the site as I came across them in the real world was really fun, but also insanely frustrating
			- As a side project, there was no months of planning by an engineering team to discuss and agree upon the best way to build this. Changes came sporadically and were layered on top of my desperate attempts to try to get React to do the thing that I wanted it to.
			- After 7 attempts at trying to build it with countless different technologies, I arrived at an app that I still not happy with.
		- I have become obsessed with the idea of Go
			- For my 8th attempt at trying to rewrite this site, I am going to write the backend in Go
			- I have many years of professional experience developing in it so that helps, but there is a better reason for this.
			- Go, in my opinion, embraces the ethos of what a LEGO is pretty well
			- Go was developed by some smart people at Bell Labs, and later was refined at Google to solve its problems:
				- Problems
			- The syntax is painfully simple, which often causes much frustration
			- People don't like the error handling
			- The pointers are pretty annoying
			- And I agree, Go is not a perfect language, if I wanted to code in a "perfect" language I would have chosen Haskell, or have just made my own with Lisp
			- Go doesn't try to do everything, it didn't have generics for many years
			- The language prioritized simplicity above all else which has led to a lot of interesting effects
				- All packages are git repos, meaning you are just downloading source code, this means you can not just see what code you are including, but also how other developers write Go "CGO is not Go"
				- How many languages let you do that?
				- The package manager is built into the CLI, along with the commands for "run", "build", "test", "benchmark", "format", etc.
				- These are usually 3rd party libraries you need to "be in the know" about for your language
				- A simple, statically typed system means contextual information about the language is always there for me to go deeper on understanding the code
			- I am not trying to evangelize Go, I am just pointing out what features I believe should be in a system, language, framework, etc. you are giving out for other people to use
			- LEGOs have rigid plastic connectors, unless you melt them, you can't mold them into a sculpture, you have to play by LEGO's unfailable rules in order to compose them together to build a sculpture
		- Thinking functionally
			- Working at Uber, I see Cadence (now Temporal), the workflow manager, scale to the size of the world
			- All that Cadence really did was harden Go's concurrency primitives to be able to scale effortlessly and reliably
			- Turns out that is a really good idea, they are worth a lot of money
			- I also got to see the internal rollout of GRPC and how much easier it was to interact with the thousands of internal microservices
			- Turns out that is also a really good idea, Buf is worth millions
			- Both of these technologies focus on programming primitives; functions and their types
