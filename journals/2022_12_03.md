	- Do what is best for you & your community.
	- Discord is more for gaming
	- Slack just feels more "professional".
	- orbit.love for example has a pretty good community on discord with office hours and other events through discord
	- Discord voice chat built in is nice
	- Usually end up solving 1 persons problem, which could be done more effectively 1on1
	- have not found a format that I am very happy with
	- What works for initial contact
		- Slack welcome message ([https://www.ory.sh/building-slack-bot-using-slack-events-api/](https://www.ory.sh/building-slack-bot-using-slack-events-api/))
		- github discussions
		- talk to people and see if we can solve their problem (or not)
	- Answer the questions
		- why does the community exist (or why should it exist)
		- who is in your community and why are they there
		- what value do you create for the community wether or not they are paying users
		- what value do members create for each other 
		  of course its not always super smooth but it helps to think about these from time to time
	- Slack
		- Almost never sanctioned in enterprises (eg firewall). discord is for gamers and thus often sanctioned/denylisted
		- Better retention because it sends emails on pings
		- People in businesses that buy software are often used to slack already
