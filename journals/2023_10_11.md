	- collect and share your structured thoughts
		- you can drop thoughts into something that lets you go deeper, such as with logseq
	- how can you easily build collections of URLs?
		- how can you index URLs so that someone can discover them easily?
	- Driven people will use AI to generate drafts of ideas that they can react to
	- Prompt packs
		- For different people, and their relevant use cases, create packs of prompts that people can use to transform content
		- I am a developer and I see an article about code that is interesting

			- The identifier here is straight forward, if we go to scrape hackernews again, the tag "hackernews/37846387" should already exist, and if the content hash, also determined by the source scraper, is the same, nothing is done, if it has changed, then add a new version of the content
				- we want to try to keep the previous content around as much as possible
