	- [https://github.com/justshare-io/justshare](https://github.com/justshare-io/justshare). It has become more of a blogging/note taking platform, somewhere between ghost and notion. The focal point is the editor, where you capture your ideas, and the tagging system puts your ideas to work. Anything tagged with "blog", is posted toÂ [https://breadchris.com/blog](https://breadchris.com/blog), and similarly, "newsletter" gets emailed to my subs. I have more tag -> destination adapters like "discord", "slack", or "notes" (write a file to disk) which I think is pretty interesting.
