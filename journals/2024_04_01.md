- #go/book naming
	- The recommendation from the authors is to use short variable names. This felt awkward initially, I wanted to be verbose in describing the purpose of a variable. If you look at standard library code, everything uses short variable names. I think what changed for me over time was that I realized that short variables 1) require less reading, meaning you can read code faster 2) variables being less descriptive are OK as long as functions aren't longer than a screen size. If you can glance at a function, you can see the start and end of a variable's life time, meaning contextual information is more readily available. The function's name and doc become more helpful in providing context clues.
