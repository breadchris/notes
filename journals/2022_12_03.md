	- I write some code that does something:
		- ```python
		  // download youtube subtitles with https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api
		  def download_subtitles(video_id: str, language: str) -> bytes:
		    # Import the required modules.
		    from googleapiclient.discovery import build
		    from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
		  
		    # Set the YouTube API key.
		    youtube_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
		  
		    # Build the YouTube API service.
		    youtube = build("youtube", "v3", developerKey=youtube_api_key)
		  
		    # Set the parameters for the subtitle download request.
		    params = {
		      "part": "snippet",
		      "videoId": video_id,
		      "type": "track",
		      "trackType": "subtitles",
		      "fields": "items(snippet(languageCode))"
		    }
		  
		    # Download the available subtitles for the specified video.
		    try:
		      subtitles = youtube.captions().list(**params).execute()
		  
		      # Check if the specified language is available.
		      for subtitle in subtitles["items"]:
		        if subtitle["snippet"]["languageCode"] == language:
		          # Download the subtitle data in the specified language.
		          params = {
		            "id": subtitle["id"],
		            "tfmt": "vtt",
		            "fields": "data"
		          }
		          subtitle_data = youtube.captions().download(**params).execute()
		  
		          # Return the raw subtitle data.
		          return subtitle_data
		    except HttpError as error:
		      print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
		      return None
		  ```
		- I write protobuf types
			- ```protobuf
			  // Define the request message for downloading subtitles from YouTube.
			  message DownloadSubtitlesRequest {
			    // The ID of the YouTube video from which to download subtitles.
			    string video_id = 1;
			  
			    // The language of the subtitles to download.
			    string language = 2;
			  }
			  
			  // Define the response message for downloading subtitles from YouTube.
			  message DownloadSubtitlesResponse {
			    // The raw subtitle data in the specified language.
			    bytes subtitle_data = 1;
			  
			    // The language of the downloaded subtitles.
			    string language = 2;
			  }
			  ```
		- A workflow orchestrator lets me seamlessly call this function from my existing backend
			- ```python
			  # Define the HTTP request handler class.
			  class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
			    # Handle GET requests.
			    def do_GET(self):
			      # Parse the query string parameters.
			      params = parse_qs(urlparse(self.path).query)
			  
			      # Get the video_id parameter from the request.
			      video_id = params.get("video_id", [""])[0]
			  
			      # Call the download_youtube_subtitles function to download subtitles.
			      subtitles = download_youtube_subtitles(video_id, "en")
			  
			      # Set the response headers.
			      self.send_response(200)
			      self.send_header("Content-type", "text/vtt")
			      self.end_headers()
			  
			      # Set the subtitles as the response body.
			      self.wfile.write(subtitles)
			  
			  # Set the HTTP server address and port.
			  server_address = ("0.0.0.0", 8080)
			  
			  # Create and start the HTTP server.
			  httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
			  httpd.serve_forever()
			  ```
			- when `download_youtube_subtitles` is called, instead of the underlying code being immediately called, the parameters of the function are serialized and it will start a workflow, the original program will block on the function being run. In the workflow, the actual code for `download_youtube_subtitles` will be run and the response will be serialized and returned. The http handler will get the result in `subtitles`.
			- Why would you do this?
				- Well, what we have effectively done is decoupled the implementation from the definition, meaning the code can be anything and run anywhere. Everything is typesafe because we are using protobufs.
			- Isn't this horribly inefficient?

- I want you to act as a Linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write explainations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly rackets {like this}. My first command is pwd.

	- Do what is best for you & your community.
	- Discord is more for gaming
	- Slack just feels more "professional".
	- orbit.love for example has a pretty good community on discord with office hours and other events through discord
	- Discord voice chat built in is nice
	- Usually end up solving 1 persons problem, which could be done more effectively 1on1
	- have not found a format that I am very happy with
	- What works for initial contact
		- Slack welcome message ([https://www.ory.sh/building-slack-bot-using-slack-events-api/](https://www.ory.sh/building-slack-bot-using-slack-events-api/))
		- github discussions
		- talk to people and see if we can solve their problem (or not)
	- Answer the questions
		- why does the community exist (or why should it exist)
		- who is in your community and why are they there
		- what value do you create for the community wether or not they are paying users
		- what value do members create for each other 
		  of course its not always super smooth but it helps to think about these from time to time
	- Slack
		- Almost never sanctioned in enterprises (eg firewall). discord is for gamers and thus often sanctioned/denylisted
		- Better retention because it sends emails on pings
		- People in businesses that buy software are often used to slack already
