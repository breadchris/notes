		- Legos
			- The first LEGO set I ever had came from Mcdonalds, probably one of the last toys you could get in a happy meal that had any redeeming quality
			- After I built it for the first time, I allegedly would walk around with it all the time
			- I would fall asleep with it
			- I noticed that these pieces didn't have to be arranged in the way I was told to do so by the instructions. I could build whatever I wanted.
			- I remember how deeply satisfying it was to arrange and rearrange this limited set of pieces   into whatever I could think of. With a little imagination a crude representation could become what I wanted it to be.
			- Buying and building LEGOs became a fixation for me. Turning a whole section of the basement into my lair filled with new sets, partially disassembled sets, and random pieces from eroded sets from years past.
			- I think my mom got me a Mega Blocks set once and somehow the pieces ended up in one of these bins. Whenever I was looting around for pieces and I came across these pieces, they would immediately throw them away. But even if a single LEGO piece was found laying around the house, I would pick it up and return it to the bin.
			- I don't know if you have had a chance to play around LEGOs all that much, but they are a very special toy to me. LEGO year after year showed what was possible to build with their catalog of bricks and to me then, and now, it is mind blowing.
			- There are many design principles that keep LEGO being LEGO. And the brand has only ever faltered when they deviated from this set of design principles.
		- Me and Code
			- What we have been able to do with code is equally as mind blowing to me.
			- When my teacher taught me how to write BASIC on a TI-83 calculator, I was blown away. Naturally my friends and I would push the limits on what you could do.
			- Java blew me away with the deep level of control that you could take over a computer or the connectivity you could get with your friends by building web applications.
			- I had the opportunity to work at Uber and see some of the world's best software engineers push code at ridiculous speed and scale.
			- I have been writing code for a minute, and after a while you start to develop a sense for what "Mega Blocks" vs "LEGO" might look like.
			- Everyone has their own opinions on
		- Cooking
			- All I wanted to do was build a recipe site
				- I like to cook
				- I find following recipes challenging
			- Why isn't this easier?
				- There are a lot of moving parts you have to figure out while you are hungry
				- Recipe sites are hard to use
					- Ads
					- Plain text
				- There is no money in recipes
					- Only high engagement users will pay for recipes (ATK, chefsteps)
					- Restaurants keep secrets
					- Granny's recipe cards ~= The Cooking Bible
			- What does a good recipe site look like?
				- It guides me
				- After looking through countless apps, I couldn't find one that helped me
