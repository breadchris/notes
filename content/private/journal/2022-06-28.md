- working on new vulnerability table being used for scanning
	- ran into a problem where grype is reporting the namespace of a package as "github:java", but "maven" should be the package manager. We are going to need to figure out how to associate packages to vulnerabilities from #grype
- grype/version/format.go FormatFromPkgType can have `java-archive` which is not covered by the switch statement
