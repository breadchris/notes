Designing Data Driven Applications by Martin Kleppmann - amazon
Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers.</description>

      <description>Testing gets a bad rap. It is usually the last step of developing a feature, when you are sure that your code runs fine. Have to keep that code codecov up. But, testing is important! How else will you know if your jenga tower of dependencies
If you search &amp;ldquo; testing&amp;rdquo; on Google, it is quite revelaling. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at popular languages and what their library a commonly use for testing:</description>

      <description>Their lovemaking was passionate, if quiet; she felt every atom of her body, his body, heavy in their node of space/time, replete with potential. Calvin breathed harshly beneath her, and she threw her hips into it with vigorous intensity, pressuring and sliding away from the place where their bodies were joined in abandon and rapidity. His eyes fluttered closed and he had to muffle a hoarse shout, and she felt him coming inside of her; when his thumb slid up to caress her clitoris, with a touch both gentle and firm, she came, too; and then again, as he returned the touch almost as soon as the first wave of convulsions had left her.</description>

      <description>It may seem silly, but go run is my favorite part about go. Want to run your code? go run main.go. It is so stupidly simple that I could tell my mom about this command, and she would immediately understand. Like with most things in go, the real power in this command is in the effortless understanding of how to build and run everyone&amp;rsquo;s code.
But I can run node main.</description>

      <description>I have been going swing dancing at Century Ballroom every week since the start of the year. Swing is a partner dance that has leaders and followers. Before every song, it is customary for the leader, typically a guy, to ask a follower, usually a girl, to dance, and when the song ends, the leader finds another follower to dance with for the next song. For someone with social anxiety, this can be pretty intimidating.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, staring at something long enough is all it takes to figure out what to improve.
I moved from the TipTap editor to BlockNote, built on TipTap, but it comes with all the features I would expect in an editor setup. I especially like what they did with the concept of blocks, which has expanded my mind about what an editor can contain. On the desktop, the editor works pretty well; there is enough space to support the information the editor will include, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look quite right on mobile.</description>

      <description>So, I have been told that I need to read Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and there is a reason for this. What is that reason? It depends on the importance of knowledge and information to the survival of society, and it&amp;rsquo;s very pertinent today, even though it was written before the Internet was invented.
When was the editor so? I think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up; I need to re-implement it, but I could do/ask if it&amp;rsquo;s there.</description>

      <description>Help me brainstorm a character
Character Crafter
Absolutely, I&amp;rsquo;d love to help you brainstorm a character! Let&amp;rsquo;s start by considering a few key elements:
Archetype: Do you have a specific archetype in mind, such as The Hero, The Rebel, The Sage, or maybe The Innocent? Each archetype brings its own set of traits and narrative possibilities.
Role in Story: Is this character your protagonist, antagonist, a sidekick, or perhaps a mentor figure?</description>

      <description>What are a list of reasons why companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all came from the same area in the PNW?
There are several factors that have contributed to companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, and Amazon all originating from the same region in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Some of the reasons include:
1. Skilled labor pool: The PNW has a strong history of highly skilled workers in fields such as manufacturing, technology, and logistics.</description>

      <title>Naming is Important</title>

      <description>Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing.</description>

In my pursuit to build larger compositions of thoughts, next year will be themed accordingly; I want to write a book. How does one go about choosing the topic to write a book about? It is probably something that you spend a lot of time thinking about.</description>

      <description>Every morning, as the first light bled into the room, the software engineer&amp;rsquo;s alarm would chirp, marking another day&amp;rsquo;s beginning. The routine was as predictable as the sunrise. Wake, stretch, sip a coffee, and sit before the computer.
The screen springs to life, revealing a grid of familiar faces. Standup meeting — the daily ritual. Each square held an expression; some were tired, some eager, but all were familiar. Pixels and bandwidth conveying nuances, the raise of an eyebrow, the half-hidden yawn.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like how long it takes for me to figure out ideas. Too much code is written before I figure out what I wanted is not what I made. There is a bookstore near me that I frequent and on the shelf was the book Drawing Ideas. Through this book, I have come to appreciate the importance of sketching in unlocking creativity and exploring new avenues of value. Through observation and simplification, sketching allows us to see our ideas projected onto a medium, much like using our voice to sketch out thoughts verbally.</description>

      <description>From the first moment I saw it, I thought that gRPC was going to change how people transferred data on the Internet. What are we using? Untyped JSON to REST endpoint? Obviously asking for problems. JSON schema? Better, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write that crap. Also tooling is annoying. GraphQL? Pretty nice. Better than gRPC when dealing with many related objects, but again tooling is eh. gRPC is built on Protobuf, a simple type system that has been battle-hardened by Google and other large companies over the past 20 years.</description>

      <description>I had a Substack where I would occasionally post some things on AI. The vision was to build a following, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t execute it. There may be some &amp;ldquo;blaming the equipment, not the player&amp;rdquo; here, but from what I have learned, my writing flow feels so much better now:
First of all, I think Substack is great. Its mission is clear, and overall, they do a great job executing it (much better than Medium, imo).</description>

      <description>Well I have gone down the rabbit hole today on changing the way that everything looks. There are still some blemishes, but there is much more space for writing content. Oh, and I also added an AI feature where if you highlight the text then it will ask you if you want to use that as a prompt and the output will be streamed into the editor. I am super stoked with the progress that I have made here.</description>

I felt myself looping on, thinking of the answer, and then being frustrated. Time passed, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my thoughts into words. Somewhere deep in my knowledge I knew how to respond, but in the moment I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer. Overall, the interviews went fine.</description>

      <description>I had a friend take me on a journey through elm today while on stream today. The exercises they gave me were really well thought out and it was a lot of fun to feel how the code evolved between each task. Starting from a simple counter, it built up to where you were managing a list of list of counters. The cycle of building the thing that just works, and then refactoring it so it could take on more abstraction illustrated why elm&amp;rsquo;s architecture shines.</description>

      <description>A common theme in high thinkies is that I want to record my thoughts in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in my way of my thoughts. For example, writing down notes has been historically difficult and when the thinkies are coming in at blistering speed, it is difficult to keep up. So I started to just talk and record what I said. Audio files are super small. I also started streaming to also document what I was working on.</description>

      <description>If you ask anyone who knows me what my thoughts are on javascript, you will get a unanimous &amp;ldquo;he hates it&amp;rdquo;. Typescript helps, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the problems I have with it are actually solvable without some radical changes in the ecosystem. Why do I care so much? Because I freaking want to build websites that stick around for a while goddamnit! Sites built with the &amp;ldquo;right decisions&amp;rdquo; today feel like they fall over from a strong breeze.</description>

      <description>I am visiting SF right now, and almost every billboard in the city has &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; on it. I need to build image upload so that I can show you what I am talking about. I get it, there is a lot of hype for companies to cash in on, so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?
AI (ML or machine learning for the pedantic) is super cool and can do a lot of things now.</description>

      <description>I like to check in, every so often, on the state of offline-first solutions. Most of what exists is focused around sqlite. Here are some of the projects that pop up frequently when I search:
cr-sqlite
mycelite
sqlite-sync
litesync (not open source)
sqlsync
The appeal of an offline-first experience is pretty well summed up by cr-sqlite&amp;rsquo;s tag line: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like Git, for your data.&amp;rdquo; We are constantly generating data, and in many different ways.</description>

✅ in markdown
✅ with full WYSIWYG, not just split view (think: Typora)
I am using https://tiptap.dev/ super easy to copy paste and add images</description>

      <description>You can think about a lot of different things all the time. Think about too many things and this becomes a serious problem, especially for those who have ADD. If you have a problem focusing on which idea to pursue, it is easy to experience the feeling of being lost. Life is happening, ideas come and go, but there is nothing for you to bring to show and tell.
I am not an expert in this field of study, but I do pay attention to what constitutes a “great thinker”.</description>

Folding 1000 origami cranes sounds at lot easier than it is. When my engineer mind latched onto the idea of completing this task, I was intrigued by the foretold wish one would get in exchange for folding a bunch of the easiest origami models. Kids do this every year in Japan, how hard could it be? - On average, it would take me 5 minutes to fold a crane from start to finish.</description>

      <description>So i was in a really good high school https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poolesville_High_School and so there would be some ridiculously smart people who would work on things and because the program was so close knit, information would disseminate between the grades and so the younger group of kids would only get that much better. I got involved in cyber security because the older kids competed in a competition that was for hacking and they did very well.</description>

      <description>- I have worked for Northrup Grumman and Uber as a security engineer and I built security tools that have been used around the world. The coolest thing that I have done in my life is that I got to help develop code that ran on every device that had Uber installed on it. The purpose of this code was to help the 20% Uber was losing to fraudulent trips. The talent needed to work on a project like this was so rare that I was hired on as the first team member, as an intern and later hired on as a college dropout.</description>

Either I or someone else who vaguely understands how to code was going to hack you like this. Business requirements for shipping that feature out at lighting speed for your largest customer last quarter made this all too easy.

      <description>## How it went wrong
I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time. The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU.</description>

Start with Markdown and hugo. Markdown is trivial to learn and making a website is instant. Hugo is a single binary you download, run and boom there is your website. A number of themes are available for you to check out and play with, but they aren’t necessary to start out.</description>

      <description>## SOLID principles
The set of five design principles for object-oriented programming that were first introduced by Robert C. Martin. These principles are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
In Go, the SOLID principles can be applied as follows:
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Example:
```go
type UserService struct {
userRepository UserRepository
}
func (us *UserService) CreateUser(user *User) error {
return us.userRepository.Create(user)
}
func (us *UserService) GetUserByID(id int) (*User, error) {</description>

      <description>## Playing with Legos
Legos are fun, they are composable. Code is not composable, not at least in the way we learn to code.
Different environments come with different constraints which end up with different code. Different ecosystems have different standards and ways to solve a problem.
Legos have been designed to have an incredibly rigid specification that has been upheld for many years. It is trivial to determine impostor bricks (I am looking at you Mega Blocks) from an actual Lego.</description>

      <description>I don’t know if I personally would say that my life has been “hard”. I hear people use this to describe their life; “I have fallen on hard times”. But I don’t know, it doesn’t seem to be a relatable feeling. I have had to solve “hard” problems. Whether it is a math problem with seemingly random symbols or trying to comprehend why my parents won’t get along with each other.</description>

Authenticity is a commodity in modern day communication. When we wake up, we look at our phone, during breakfast, we look at our phone, at work when we are bored, we look at our phone, going to the bathroom? phone. Watching TV? phone. Avoiding going to bed? phone.</description>

      <description>I have been building a workflow engine that can route strongly-typed data through durable functions (guaranteed to execute). These functions do not need to exist in the process, they could be remote APIs, grpc servers, a p2p connection with your friend&amp;rsquo;s computer. It supports streaming of data with observables, thanks to rxgo, meaning you can create rules to map, filter, reduce data without redeployment.
This is the sketch I have in my head, and have been trying to implement it here.</description>

      <description>If someone were to talk to me about connecting my body to my mind a decade ago, I would have thought they were full of it. Regularly practicing meditation and now yoga has really made me realize how stupid you must be not to build this connection with yourself. Humans all have this incredible biological computer sitting inside their head and if you treat it as just that, a computer, it can do cool things.</description>

      <description>There has been a part of this code that I have been wanting to refactor for a while. Patch on patch of this form has left this code in disarray. This code is actually quite important to this site as well. It is a general application form that leverages the power of Protobuf&amp;rsquo;s expressive type system to generate a form a user can interact with. I have some ideas for where I want to take this code, but they haven&amp;rsquo;t been a priority.</description>

      <description>Idk what happened this morning but I went through my normal routine and then something just hit me which crippled my momentum. I have learned that listening to my body and trying to meet it where it is at in the moment vs trying to fight the feeling pays dividends over time. I try to map the feeling to a probability of what it is that I need. Often this feeling comes from not having enough water, so I drank some water and took a 20 minute nap.</description>

      <description>It bothers me that more people don&amp;rsquo;t have personal sites. In my opinion, we all do interesting things. In order to communicate the interesting things that we do, we need to provide others with an immersive experience of our world. Personal sites of designers and artists attempt to capture our imagination with an elegantly simple and refreshing display of their portfolios or wild 3d graphics. It makes sense why this isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm, these sites take time.</description>

      <description>I had a call with a friend who was a hacker in the golden days of hacking. There were lots of exciting things happening in security as problems were unearthed, and solutions theorized. Over time, these problems that came up became solved. Buffers got compiler and runtime checks. SQL injection doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when you use prepared statements. XSS doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist if you use React. The bread and butter of what hackers were poking at slowly shrunk as companies changed their development practices.</description>

      <description>There are many things that I could be doing. I have spent a lot of time doing cyber security, I have spent a lot of time coding, maybe if I am lucky I could be a baker from all the time I have spent baking. But there is only so much time in the day. There are only so many things that you can get 10,000 hours of mastery over. And even if you have &amp;ldquo;mastered&amp;rdquo; it, have you felt good doing it?</description>

      <description>I think there are some really cool things that you get when you dogfood the thing you are building. For those who are unfamiliar with &amp;ldquo;dogfood&amp;rdquo;, as it relates to the tech world, it means to use it yourself. I have not had much focus on the projects that I have been working on, and now that I am directly dogfooding the app, which aims to help me increase the frequency and quality of how I write, I am held accountable.</description>
