	- Terminology used to express protoflow concepts should be intuitive and comprehensible to a high school student in computer
	- When using protoflow there are typed and untyped blocks. Typed blocks use protobuf to enforce types, untyped uses json.
	- There are also different collections of blocks. Each collection contains blocks that may refer to themselves safely. Collections that are self contained should be able to be deployed as a standalone service. Collections that refer to blocks in other collections will have to resolve if the target collection is self contained, or if additional state is needed to set up the collection.
		- A collection that depends, specifically on an AWS resource is not considered to be self-contained, where as if the resource was more generally defined as a "Bucket", a local folder may be used as the implementation, making it self contained.
	- All blocks should enumerate as much environmental state as possible (ie. configuration, secrets, resources, dependencies) and should not be controlled by the block. State should be easier to define with the provided tools (ex. UI, SDK) than existing language libraries.

	- Simple LLM Finetuner is a beginner-friendly user interface that enables users to fine-tune language models with the PEFT library and LoRA method on NVIDIA GPUs. It can be installed on Linux or Windows machines with a modern NVIDIA GPU with at least 16 GB of VRAM and can be run on regular Colab Tesla T4 instances.
