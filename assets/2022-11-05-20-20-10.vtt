because I can record my voice and just put this at the big before this next

00:15.520 --> 00:19.400
thing that you're going to about to listen to and so the podcast might be in

00:19.400 --> 00:26.820
multiple parts but I can just like say like okay I need the podcast like click

00:26.820 --> 00:30.780

00:30.780 --> 00:38.940
plug-in anyway you're there's it's gonna be a wild ride just prepping you

00:38.940 --> 00:43.780
whatever's listening to this so please keep that mind when you're listening to

00:43.780 --> 00:49.940

00:49.940 --> 00:59.580
you might listen to after this is it's gonna be crazy anyway have fun
